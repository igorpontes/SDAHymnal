26  Praise the Lord! You Heavens Adore Him


1

Praise the Lord: you heavens, adore Him; Praise Him, angels in the height;

Sun and moon, rejoice before Him; praise Him, all you stars of light. Praise the Lord, for He has spoken; worlds His mighty voice obeyed. Laws which never shall be broken for their guidance He has made.


2

Praise the Lord! for He is glorious; never shall His promise fail.

God has made His saints victorious; sin and death shall not prevail. Praise the God of our salvation! hosts on high, His power proclaim. Heaven and earth and all creation, laud and magnify His Name.


3

Worship, honor, glory, blessing, Lord, we offer as our gift.

Young and old, Your praise expressing, Our glad songs to You we lift.

All the saints in heaven adore You; we would join their glad acclaim;
As Your angels serve before You, so on earth we praise Your name.
