Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven 


1

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven; To His feet thy tribute bring. Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Who like thee His praise should sing? Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia, Praise the everlasting King.


2

Praise Him for His grace and favor To our fathers in distress.

Praise Him, still the same forever, Slow to chide and swift to bless; Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia, Glorious in His faithfulness.


3

Tenderly He shields and spares us; Well our feeble frame He knows. In His hands He gently bears us, Rescues us from all our foes. Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia, Widely as His mercy flows.


4

Angels, help us to adore Him: Ye behold Him face to face;
Sun and moon, bow down before Him: Dwellers all in time and space.

Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia, Praise with us the God of grace.
