156  O Sacred Head Now Wounded


1
O sacred Head, now wounded,

with grief and shame weighed down, now scornfully surounded

with thorns, thine only crown: how pale thou art with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn!

How does that visage languish which once was bright as morn!


2

What thou, my Lord, has suffered was all for sinners' gain;

mine, mine was the transgression, but thine the deadly pain.

Lo, here I fall, my Savior! 'Tis I deserve thy place; look on me with thy favor, vouchsafe to me thy grace.


3

What language shall I borrow to thank thee, dearest friend, for this thy dying sorrow, thy pity without end?

O make me thine forever; and should I fainting be,
Lord, let me never, never outlive my love for thee.
