God of Grace and God of Glory

1
God of grace and God of glory,
On Thy people pour Thy power;
Now fulfill Thy church’s story,
Bring her bud to glorious flower.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
For the facing of this hour.

2
Lo, the hosts of evil round us
Scorn Thy Christ, assail His ways;
From the fears that long have bound us
Free our hearts to faith and praise.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
For the facing of this hour.

3
Cure Thy children’s warring madness,
Bend our pride to Thy control;
Shame our wanton selfish gladness
Rich in goods and poor in soul.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal.
4
Set our feet on lofty places,
Gird our lives that they may be
Armored with all Christ-like graces
In the fight to set all free.
Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
That we fail not man nor Thee.
