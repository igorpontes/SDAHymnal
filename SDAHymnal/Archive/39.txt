39  Lord, in the Morning


1

Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear My voice ascending high;

To Thee will I direct my prayer, To Thee lift up mine eye-


2

Up to the hills where Christ is gone To plead for all His saints, Presenting at His Father's throne Our songs and our complaints.


3

O may Thy Spirit guide my feet In ways of righteousness; Make every path of duty straight And plain before my face.


4

The men that love and fear Thy name Shall see their hopes fulfilled;

The mighty God will compass them With favor as a shield.
