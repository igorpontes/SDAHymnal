I Want Jesus to Walk With Me

1
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)
All along my pilgrim journey,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)

2
In my trials, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
In my trials, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
When the shades of life are falling,

I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)

3
In my sorrows, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
In my sorrows, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
When my heart within is aching,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)
