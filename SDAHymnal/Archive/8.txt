We Gather Together 


1

We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing; He chastens and hastens His will to make known.

The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing. Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.


2

Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining, Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;

So from the beginning the fight we were winning; Thou, Lord, were at our side, all glory be Thine!


3

We all do extol Thee, Thou leader triumphant, And pray that Thou still our defender wilt be. Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;
Thy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!
