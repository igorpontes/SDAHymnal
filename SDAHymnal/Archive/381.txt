Holy Sabbath Day of Rest

1
Holy Sabbath day of rest,
By our Master richly blest,
God created and divine,
Set aside for holy time.

Refrain:
Yes, the holy Sabbath rest,
By our God divinely blest,
It to us a sign shall be
Throughout all eternity.

2
Seek not pleasures of this earth,
With its folly, noise, and mirth,
There are better things in store,
Over on the other shore.

3
As the Sabbath draweth on
Friday eve at set of sun,
Christian household then should meet,
Sing and pray at Jesus’feet.
4
Asking Him for saving grace,
Also vict’ry in the race,
And to help us by His pow’r,
To keep holy every hour.
