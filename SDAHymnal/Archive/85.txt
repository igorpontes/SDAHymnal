85  Eternal Father, Strong to Save


1
Eternal Father, strong to save,

Whose arm hath bound the restless wave, Who bid'st the mighty ocean deep

Its own appointed limits keep; Oh hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea.

O Christ, whose voice the waters heard, And hushed their raging at Thy word, Who walkedst on the foaming deep, And calm amidst its rage didst sleep; Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.


3

O Holy Spirit, who didst brood Upon the waters dark and rude, And bid their angry tumult cease, And give, for wild confusion, peace: Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea.

O Trinity of love and power,

All trav'lers shield in danger's hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe, Protect them wheresoe'er they go; Thus evermore shall rise to The

Glad humns of praise from land and sea.
