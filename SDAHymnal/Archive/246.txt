Worthy, Worthy Is the Lamb

1
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
That was slain.

Refrain:
Glory, hallelujah!
Praise Him, hallelujah!
Glory, hallelujah!
To the Lamb!

2
Savior, let Thy kingdom come!
Now the power of sin consume;
Bring Thy blest millennium,
Holy Lamb.

3
Thus may we
each moment feel,
Love Him, serve Him,
praise Him still,
Till we all on Zion’s hill
See the Lamb.
