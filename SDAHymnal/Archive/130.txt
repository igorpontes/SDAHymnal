130  It Came Upon the Midnight Clear


1

It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old,

from angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold; "Peace on earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious King!" The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing.


2

Still through the cloven skies they come, with peaceful wings unfurled;

And still their heav'nly music floats o'er all the weary world;

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing; And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing!


3

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long; beneath the angel strain have rolled two thousand years of wrong;

And man, at war with man, hears not the love song which they bring
O hush the noise, ye men of strife, and hear the angels sing!


4

For lo! The days are hast'ning on, by prophet bards foretold,

When, with the ever circling years, comes round the age of gold; When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling;

And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing!
