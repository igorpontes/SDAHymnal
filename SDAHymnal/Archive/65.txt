65  God Be With You


1

God be with you till we meet again; By His counsels guide, uphold you, With His sheep securely fold you; God be with you till we meet again.


Refrain

Till we meet, till we meet, Till we meet at Jesus' feet; Till we meet, till we meet,

God be with you till we meet again.


2

God be with you till we meet again; 'Neath His wings securely hide you; Daily manna still provide you; God be with you till we meet again.


3

God be with you till we meet again; When life's perils thick confound you; Put His arms unfailing round you; God be with you till we meet again.


4

God be with you till we meet again; Keep love's banner floating over you,
Strike death's threatening wave before you; God be with you till we meet again.
