1

Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation! O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation! All ye who hear, now to His temple draw near;

Join ye in glad adoration!


2

Praise to the Lord, Who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth, Shieldeth thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth! Hast thou not seen how thy desires e'er have been

Granted in what He ordaineth?


3

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee; Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.

Ponder anew what the Almighty can do, If with His love He befriend thee.

God Himself Is With Us
</title>
<lyric>
1
God Himself is with us;
Let us all adore Him,
And with awe appear before Him.
God is here within us;
Soul, in silence fear Him,
Humbly, fervently draw near Him.
Now His own who have known God,
In worship lowly,
Yield their spirits wholly.

2
Come, abide within me;
Let my soul, like Mary,
Be Thine earthly sanctuary.
Come, indwelling Spirit,
With transfigured splendor;
Love and honor will I render.
Where I go here below,
Let me bow before Thee,
Know Thee and adore Thee.


3
Gladly we surrender
Earth’s deceitful treasures,
Pride of life and sinful pleasures:
Gladly, Lord, we offer
Thine to be forever,
Soul and life and each endeavor.
Thou alone shall be known
Lord of all our being,
Life’s true way decreeing.

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven; To His feet thy tribute bring. Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Who like thee His praise should sing? Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia, Praise the everlasting King.

Praise Him for His grace and favor To our fathers in distress.

Praise Him, still the same forever, Slow to chide and swift to bless; Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia, Glorious in His faithfulness.


3

Tenderly He shields and spares us; Well our feeble frame He knows. In His hands He gently bears us, Rescues us from all our foes. Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia, Widely as His mercy flows.


4

Angels, help us to adore Him: Ye behold Him face to face;
Sun and moon, bow down before Him: Dwellers all in time and space.

Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia, Praise with us the God of grace.

All My Hope on God Is Founded
</title>
<lyric>
1
All my hope on God is founded;
He doth still my trust renew.
Me through change and chance He guideth,
Only good and only true.
God unknown, He alone
Calls my heart to be His own.

2
Pride of man and earthly glory,
Sword and crown betray his trust;
What with care and toil he buildeth,
Tower and temple fall to dust.
But God’s power, hour by hour,
Is my temple and my tower.

3
God’s great goodness aye endureth,
Deep His wisdom, passing thought;
Splendor, light and life attend Him,
Beauty springeth out of naught.
Love doth stand at His hand;
Joy doth wait on His command.
4
Still from man to God eternal,
Sacrifice of praise be done.
High above all praises praising,
For the gift of Christ His son.
Christ doth call one and all:
Ye who follow shall not fall.

O Worship the Lord 
</title>
<lyric>
1

O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness, Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim; With gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness, Kneel and adore Him: the Lord is His name.


2

Low at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness, High on His heart He will bear it for thee, Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness, Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.


3

Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine; Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness, These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.


4

These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness, He will accept for the name that is dear;

Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness, Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.

1
The Lord in Zion reigneth, let all the world rejoice,

And come before His throne of grace with tuneful heart and voice;

The Lord in Zion reigneth, and there His praise shall ring,

To Him shall princes bend the knee and kings their glory bring.


2
The Lord in Zion reigneth, and who so great as He?

The depths of earth are in His hands; He rules the mighty sea. O crown His Name with honor, and let His standard wave, Till distant isles beyond the deep shall own His power to save.

The Lord in Zion reigneth, these hours to Him belong;

O enter now His temple gates, and fill His courts with song; Beneath His royal banner let every creature fall,

Exalt the King of heaven and earth, and crown Him Lord of all.

So from the beginning the fight we were winning; Thou, Lord, were at our side, all glory be Thine!

Thy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!

New songs of celebration render
To Him who has great wonders done.
Love sits enthroned in ageless splendor:
Come, and adore the mighty One.
He has made known His great salvation
Which all His friends with joy confess:
He has revealed to every nation
His everlasting righteousness.

Joyfully, heartily resounding,
Let every instrument and voice
Peal out the praise of grace abounding
Calling the whole world to rejoice.
Trumpets and organs, set in motion
Such sounds as make the heavens ring;
All things that live in earth and ocean,
Make music for your mighty King.

Rivers and seas and torrents roaring,
Honor the Lord with wild acclaim;
Mountains and stones look up adoring,
And find a voice to praise His name.
Righteous, commanding, ever glorious,
Praises be His that never cease:
Just is our God, whose truth victorious,
Establishes the world in peace.

Lord of all being, throned afar,
Thy glory flames from sun and star;
Center and soul of every sphere
Yet to each loving heart how near!
Yet to each loving heart how near!

Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray
Shed on our path the glow of day;
Star of our hope, Thy softened light
Cheers the long watches of the night,
Cheers the long watches of the night.

3
Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;
Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;
Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy’s sign;
All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine,
All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.

Lord of all life, below, above
Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,
Before Thy ever-blazing throne
We ask no luster of our own,
We ask no luster of our own.

5
Grant us Thy truth to make us free
And kindling hearts that burn for Thee;
Till all Thy living altars claim
One holy light, one heavenly flame!
One holy light, one heavenly flame.

You shine with God’s own truth and light,
Aglow with grace and mercy!
Of Jacob’s race, King David’s son,

Our hearts to serve You only!

O draw near us! For You teach us
God’s own love through You has reached us.

You loved us, when not yet begun
Was this old earth’s foundation!

To live in Him here and above:
This is Your great salvation.

To us giving life forever,
Keeps us Yours and fails us never!

Our joy be all with music crowned,
Our voices gaily blending!

Jubilation! Exultation!
Tell the story!
Great is He, the King of glory!

Immortal, invisible, God only wise, In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,

Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.

Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might; Thy justice, like mountains, high soaring above

Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small; In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;

We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree, And wither and perish - but naught changeth Thee.

God is our Song, and every singer blest
Who praising Him finds energy and rest.
All who praise God with unaffected joy
Give back to us the widom we destroy,
Give back to us the widom we destroy.

God is our Song, for Jesus comes to save;
While praising Him we offer all we have.
New songs we sing, in ventures new unite,
When Jesus leads us upward into light,
When Jesus leads us upward into light.

3
This is our Song no conflict ever drowns;
Who praises God our human wrath disowns.
Love knows what rich complexities of sound
God builds upon a simple common ground,
God builds upon a simple common ground.



4
God is our Silence when no songs are sung,
When ecstasy or sorrow stills the tongue.
Glorious the faith which silently obeys
Until we find again the voice of praise,
Until we find again the voice of praise.

Wake the song, wake the song, The song of joy and gladness, Wake the song, wake the song, The song of Jubilee.


2

Joyfully with songs and banners, We will greet the festal day; Shout aloud our glad hosannas, And our grateful homage pay. We will chant our Savior's glory while our thoughts we raise above, Telling still the old, old, story, Precious theme- redeeming love!


3
Thanks to Thee, O holy Father, For the mercies of the year;

May each heart, as here we gather, Swell with gratitude sincere, Thanks to Thee, O loving Savior, For redemption through Thy blood. Breathe upon us, Holy Spirit, Sweetly draw us near to God.

With Songs and Honors
</title>
<lyric>
1
With songs and honors sounding loud,
Address the Lord on high;
Over the heavens He spreads His cloud,
And waters veil the sky.

2
He sends His showers of blessing down
To cheer the plains below;
He makes the grass the mountains crown,
And corning valleys grow.

3
His steady counsels change the face
Of the declining year;
He bids the sun cut short his race,
And wintry days appear.

4
He sends His word, and melts the snow;
The fields no longer mourn;
He calls the warmer gales to blow,
And bids the spring return.

5
The changing wind, the flying cloud,
Obey His mighty word:
With songs and honors sounding loud
Praise ye the sovereign Lord!

O Thou in Whose Presence
</title>
<lyric>
1
O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,
On whom in affliction I call,
My comfort by day and my song in the night,
My hope, my salvation, my all!

2
His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,
Is heard through the shadows of death;
The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,
The air is perfumed with His breath.

3
His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,
To water the gardens of grace;
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
And bask in the smiles of His face.

4
He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
And myriads wait for His word;
He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.

O Sing, My Soul, Your Maker's Praise

1
O sing my soul, your Maker’s praise
In grateful hymns ascending;
Whose steadfast love has crowned your days
With heav’nly gifts un ending.
I sought the Lord, He heard my cry;
His holy angels hover nigh
The tents of those who love Him.

2
The Lord is good to those who seek
His face in time of sorrow,
Providing comfort to the weak
And grace for each tomorrow.
Though grief may tarry for a night,
The morn shall break in joy and light
With blessings from His presence.

3
The Lord will turn His face in peace
When troubled souls draw near Him;
His loving kindness shall not cease
To those who trust and fear Him.
Our God will not forsake His own;
Eternal is His heav’nly throne;
His kingdom stands forever.

Stretch forth to things eternal

His banquet of love
Awaits you above;
Yet here He grants a foretaste of the feast
to come!
Rejoice, my soul, rejoice,
To heav’n lift up your voice:
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

Now hear the harps of heav’n!
Oh, hear the song victorious,
The never-ending anthem sounding
through the sky!
To mortals is not giv’n
To join in strains so glorious;

Yet here on earth we too can sing
our praises high!
He bought with His blood
The ransomed of God;
To Him be everlasting pow’r and victory.
And let the great amen
Resound through heav’n again.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

The Dawn of God's Dear Sabbath
</title>
<lyric>
1
The dawn of God’s dear Sabbath
Breaks o’er the earth again,
As some sweet summer morning
After a night of pain;
It comes as cooling showers
To some exhausted land,
As shade of clustered palm trees
‘Mid weary wastes of sand.

2
Lord, we would bring for offering,
Though marred with earthly soil,
A week of earnest labor,
Of steady, faithful toil,
Fair fruits of self denial,
Of strong, deep love to Thee,
Fostered by Thine own Spirit,
In true humility.

3
And we would bring our burden
Of sinful thought and deed,
In Thy pure presence kneeling,
From bondage to be freed,
Our heart’s most bitter sorrow
For all Thy work undone-
So many talents wasted!
So few bright laurels won!

4
And with that sorrow mingling,
A steadfast faith, and sure,
And love so deep and fervent,
For Thee to make it pure,
In Thy dear presence finding
The pardon that we need,
And then the peace so lasting-
Celestial peace indeed.

With faith like noontide shining bright,

From evil sights would turn our eyes,

And night in turn is drawing on,
With conscience by the world unstained

The powers of darkness fear when this sweet chant they hear: May Jesus Christ be praised!

Ye nations of mankind, in this your concord find, May Jesus Christ praised!

Let all the earth around ring joyous with the sound, May Jesus Christ praised!

Born of the one light Eden saw play!

Slumber sweet Your mercy send us,

Precious all that now reminds us

How to use this house of prayer:
He who loved and cleansed His temple
Wants us all to worship there.

Of a world which must be won!

Long endeavoured, scarce begun!

seek in worship to explore
what it means in daily living
to believe and to adore.

in an age of change and doubt,

Like a river glorious, is God's perfect peace, Over all victorious, in its bright increase; Perfect, yet it floweth, fuller every day, Perfect, yet it groweth, deeper all the way.


Refrain

Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blessed Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.

Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand, Never foe can follow, never traitor stand; Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care, Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.

Every joy or trial falleth from above, Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love; We may trust Him fully all for us to do.

They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.

O Joy that seekest me through pain, I cannot close my heart to thee;

I trace the rainbow thru the rain, and feel the promise is not vain, that morn shall tearless be.

Eternal, and yet ever new;
Uncomprehended and unbought,

Sent by the Father from on high,

O world of God, so vast and strange,
Profound and wonderful and fair,
Beyond the utmost reach of thought,
But not beyond a Father’s care!
We are not strangers on this earth
Whirling amid the suns of space;
We are God’s children, this our home,
With those of every clime and race.

2
O world of man where life is lived,
So strangely mingling joy and pain,
So full of evil and of good,
So needful that the god shall reign!
It is this world that God has loved,
And goodness was its Maker’s plan,
The promise of God’s triumph is
His coming in a Son of Man.

3
O world of time’s far-stretching years!
There was a day when time stood still,
A central moment when there rose
A cross upon a cruel hill;
In pain and death love’s power was seen,
The mystery of time revealed,
The wisdom of the ways of God,
The grace through which man’s hurt is healed.

Though I Speak With Tongues

1
Though I speak with tongues of men and angels,
Though I have the prophet’s gift,
Though I hold the keys to hidden knowledge,
Though my faith can mountains shift;
Without love I am no better,
Without love it’s all for naught;
Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:
What this means I would be taught.

2
Love is patient, knows no envy,
Never gloats when others sin;
Love is never glad to see injustice,
Always wants the truth to win.
There’s no end to love’s endurance,
There’s no test it cannot face;
Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:
I shall fail without Your grace.

3
Though there’ll be an end to hidden knowledge,
Visions, raptures, prophecy:
Faith and hope and love shall last forever,
Love the greatest of the three.
Without love I am no better,
Without love it’s all for naught;
Lord, You gave Your life in saving others:
What this means I would be taught.

Before Jehovah's awful throne, Ye nations, bow with sacred joy; Know that the Lord is God alone; He can create, and He destroy.

His sovereign power, without our aid, Made us of clay, and formed us men;

and when like wandering sheep we strayed, He brought us to His fold again.


3

We'll crowd His gates with thankful songs, High as the heavens our voices raise; And earth, with her ten thousand tongues, Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.

Wide as the world is His command, Vast as Eternity His love;

Firm as a rock His truth shall stand, When rolling years shall cease to move.

His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form, And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite? It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;

It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain, And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end! Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.

From rock and tempest, fire and foe, Protect them wheresoe'er they go; Thus evermore shall rise to The

When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made
I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

How great Thou art
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

When through the woods
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When I look down
From lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook and feel the gentle breeze

3
And when I think
That God His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross
My burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin.

4
When Christ shall come
With shouts of acclamation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And then proclaim
“My God, how great Thou art!”

Forming rock and shaping spar,
Set all life and growth in motion,

He who calls the earth to order

Thro’ events long past and gone,
Showing still today His purpose,
Speaks supremely through His Son;
He who calls the earth to order
Gives His word and it is done.

Christ is servant, Christ is Lord -
Calls us to a life of service,
Heart and will to action stirred;
He who uses man’s obedience
Has the first and final word.

With angels join to praise the Lamb,

Slumbered at their leisurek,
Now be stirring, green and strong,
Find in growth their pleasure:
All the world with beauty fills,
Gold the green enhacing;
Flowers make glee among the hills,
Set the meadows dancing.

Beauty follows all His ways,
As the world He blesses:

Artist without rival,
In His grace of glad new birth
We must seek revival.

While all the stars that round her burn, And all the planets in their turn, Confirm the tidings as they roll,

And spread the truth from pole to pole

What though in solemn silence all Move round the dark terrestrial ball? What though no real voice nor sound Amid their radiant orbs be found? In reason's ear they all rejoice
And utter forth a glorious voice,
Forever singing as they shine, &quot;The hand that made us is divine.&quot;

O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come,

our shelter from the stormy blast, and our eternal home!


2

Under the shadow of thy throne, still may we dwell secure; sufficient is thine arm alone, and our defense is sure.


3

Before the hills in order stood, or earth received her frame, from everlasting, thou art God, to endless years the same.


4

A thousand ages, in thy sight, are like an evening gone;

short as the watch that ends the night, before the rising sun.


5

O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come;
be thou our guide while life shall last, and our eternal home!

My Shepherd Will Supply My Need
</title>
<lyric>
1
My Shepherd will supply my need,
Jehovah is His name.
In pastures fresh He makes me feed
Beside the living stream.
He brings my wand’ring spirit back
When I forsake His ways,
And leads, me for His mercy’s sake,
In paths of truth and grace.

2
When I walk through the shades of death,
Thy presence is my stay;
A word of Thy supporting breath
Drives all my fears away.
Thy hand in sight of all my foes
Doth still my table spread;
My cup with blessings overflows,
Thine oil anoints my head.

3
The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days;
O may Thy house be mine abode
And all my work be praise.
There would I find a settled rest
While others go and come;
No more a stranger or a guest,
But like a child at home.

Sing to the great Jehovah’s praise!
All praise to Him belongs;
Who kindly lengthens out our days,
In spires our choicest songs,

Another various year;
We all, with vows and anthems new,
Before our God appear,

And Thy continued care;
To Thee presenting through Thy Son
What e’er we have and are,

Mercy and truth are all His ways:

From guilt and darkness and the grave:

God Moves in a Mysterious Way
</title>
<lyric>
1
God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.

2
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your head.

3
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace;
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.

4
His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.

5
Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan His work in vain;
God is His own interpreter,
And He will make it plain.

Amazing Grace

<lyric>
1

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found; was blind, but now I see.


2

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved;

how precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed.


3

The Lord has promised good to me, his word my hope secures;

he will my shield and portion be, as long as life endures.


4

Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come;

'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home.


5

When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun,
we've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun.

Marvelous grace of our loving Lord. Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt! Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured

There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

Grace that will pardon and cleanse within Grace, grace, God's grace,

Grace that is greater than all our sin!

Sin and despair, like the seawaves cold, Threaten the soul with infinite loss; Grace that is greater yes grace untold Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.

God’s free mercy streameth over all the world,
And His banner gleameth, By His church unfuried;
Broad and deep and glorious, As the heaven above,
Shines in might victorious His eternal love.

Summer suns are glowing over land and sea;
Happy light is flowing, Bountiful and free;
Everything rejoices in the mellow rays;
Earth’s ten thousand voices swell the psalm of praise.

3
Lord, upon our blindness thy pure radiance pour;
For Thy loving kindness we would love Thee more;
And when clouds are drifting dark across the sky,
Then, the veil uplifting, father, be Thou nigh.

Life is dark without Thee, death with Thee is bright.
Light of light, shine o’er us on our pilgrim way,
Go Thou still before us to the endless day.

Cleansed and made me whole,

There’s a wideness, in God’s mercy,

There is mercy, with the Savior,
There is healing in His blood.

For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of man’s mind.

The First Noel
</title>
<lyric>

The first noel the angel did say

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay; In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,

On a cold winter's night that was so deep.


Refrain

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel


2

They looked up and say a star Shining in the east, beyond them far, And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.


3

And by the light of that same star, Three wise men came from country far, And to the earth it gave great light, And to follow the star wherever it went.


4

This star drew nigh to the northwest, O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,

And there it did both stop and stay, Right over the place where Jesus lay.
5

Then entered in those wise men three, Full reverently upon the knee,

And offered there, in His presence, Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.

Come and worship, Come and worship, Worship Christ, the newborn King.

Sages, leave your contemplations, Brighter visions beam afar;

Seek the great Desire of nations; Ye have seen His natal star;

Come and worship, Come and worship, Worship Christ, the newborn King.

Suddenly the Lord, descending, In His temple shall appear;

Come and worship, Come and worship, Worship Christ, the newborn King.

For the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King!

In the homes of the nations that Jesus is King!

Leading onward, beaming bright So, most glorious Lord, may we Evermore be led to Thee.

Him Whom heaven and earth adore; So may we with willing feet

Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.

Holy Jesus, every day Keep us in the narrow way;
And, when earthly things are past, Bring our ransomed souls at last Where they need no star to guide, Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

Thou its sun which goes not down; There forever may we sing Alleluias to our King!

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.

Frosty wind made moan;
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter,
Long ago.

Angels and archangels
May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air:
But His mother only
In her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved
With a kiss.

3
What can I give Him,
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb;
If I were a wise man
I would do my part;
Yet what can I give Him?
Give my heart.

It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old,

from angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold; &quot;Peace on earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious King!&quot; The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing.


2

Still through the cloven skies they come, with peaceful wings unfurled;

And still their heav'nly music floats o'er all the weary world;

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing; And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing!


3

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long; beneath the angel strain have rolled two thousand years of wrong;

And man, at war with man, hears not the love song which they bring
O hush the noise, ye men of strife, and hear the angels sing!


4

For lo! The days are hast'ning on, by prophet bards foretold,

When, with the ever circling years, comes round the age of gold; When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling;

And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing!

The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee tonight.

the angels keep Their watch of wondering love.

O morning stars, together Proclaim the holy birth!

And praises sing to God the King, And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently The wondrous gift is given!

So God imparts to human hearts The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming; But in this world of sin, Where meek souls will recieve Him still,

The dear Christ enters in.

Rise Up, Shepherd, and Follow
</title>
<lyric>
1

There's a star in the east on Christmas morn. Rise up shepherd, and follow.

It will lead to the place where the Savior's born, Rise up shepherd, and follow.


Refrain

Leave your sheep and leave your lambs, Rise up, shepherd, and follow.

Leave your ewes and leave your rams, Rise up shepherd, and follow.
Follow, follow, Rise up, shepherd and follow.

Follow the star of Behlehem, Rise up, shepherd, and follow.


2

If you take good heed to the angel's words, Rise up, shepherd, and follow.

You'll forget your flocks, you'll forget your herds, Rise up, shepherd, and follow.

While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks
</title>
<lyric>
1
While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around.

2
“Fear nor!” said he- for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind-
“Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
To you and all mankind.

3
“To you, in David’s town this day,
Is born of David’s line,
The Savior who is Christ the Lord;
And this shall be the sign:

4
“The heavenly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
And in a manger laid.”

5
Thus spake the seraph; and forth with
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels praising God on high,
Who thus addressed their song:

6
“All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace;
Good will henceforth from heaven to men,
Begin and never cease!”

Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne
</title>
<lyric>
1
Thou didst leave Thy throne
And Thy kingly crown
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem’s home
Was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity.

Refrain:
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee.

2
Heaven’s arches rang
When the angels sang
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth
Didst Thou come to earth,
And in greatest humility.

3
The foxes found rest,
And the birds their nest
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod,
O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee.

4
Thou camest, O Lord,
With the living word
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn,
And with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary.

5
When the heavens shall ring,
And the angels sing,
At Thy coming to victory,
Let Thy voice call me home,
Saying, “Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee.”

Refrain:
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest for me.

What Child Is This?
</title>
<lyric>
1

What child is this, who, laid to rest, On Mary`s lap is sleeping?

Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, While shepherds watch are keeping?


Refrain

This, this is Christ the King,

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing: Haste, haste to bring Him laud,

The babe, the son of Mary.


2

Why lies He in such mean estate Where ox and ass are feeding? Good Christian, fear: for sinners here The silent Word is pleading.


3

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh, Come, peasant, king, to own Him, The King of kings salvation brings, Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

Angels we have heard on high, Singing sweetly through the night, And the mountains, in reply, Echoing their brave delight.


Refrain

Gloria, in excelsis Deo,
Gloria in excelsis Deo.


2

Shepherds, why this jubilee? Why this songs of happy cheer? What great brightness did you see? What glad tidings did you hear?


3

Come to Bethlehem and see Him whose birth the angels sing; Come adore, on bended knee,

Christ the Lord, the newborn King.


4

See Him in a manger laid, Whom the angels praise above; Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, While we raise our hearts in love.

Radiant beams from Thy holy face, with the dawn of redeeming grace, Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,

O Sing a Song of Bethlehem

<lyric>
1
O sing a song of Bethlehem,
Of shepherds watching there,
And of the news that came to them
From angels in the air:
The light that shone on Bethlehem
Fills all the world today;
Of Jesus’birth and peace on earth
The angels sing alway.

2
O sing a song of Nazareth,
Of sunny days of joy,
O sing of fragrant flowers breath,
And of the sinless Boy:
For now the flowers of Nazareth
In every heart may grow;
Now spreads the fame of His dear name
On all the winds that blow.



3
O sing a song of Calvary,
Its glory and dismay;
Of Him who hung upon the tree,
And took our sins away:
For He who died on Calvary
Is risen from the grave;
And Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored,
Is mighty now to save.

Songs of Thankfulness and Praise

1
Songs of thankfulness and praise,
Jesus, Lord, to You we raise,
Manifested by the star
To the sages from afar;
Branch of royal David’s stem
In Your birth at Bethlehem;
Anthems be to You addressed,
God in man made manifest.

2
Manifest at Jordan’s stream,
Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;
And at Cana, wedding guest,
In Your Godhead manifest;
Manifest in power divine,
Changing water into wine;
Anthems be to You addressed,
God in man made manifest.

3
Manifest in making whole
Palsied limbs and fainting soul;
Manifest in valiant fight,
Quelling all the devil’s might;
Manifest in gracious will,
Ever bringing good from ill;
Anthems be to You addressed,
God in man made manifest.

4
Grant us grace to see You, Lord,
Mirrored in Your holy Word;
May we imitate Your way,
And be pure, as pure as we may,
That we like You may be
At Your great epiphany;
Let us praise You, ever blest,
God in man made manifest.

I Think When I Read That Sweet Story
</title>
<lyric>
1

I think when I read that sweet story of old, When Jesus was here among men,

How He called little children as lambs to His fold,

I should like to have been with Him then.


2

I wish that His hands had been placed on my head, That His arm had been thrown around me,

And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,

&quot;Let the little ones come unto Me.&quot;


3

I long for the joy of that glorious time, The sweetest and brightest and best, When the dear little children of every clime Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.

Christ Upon the Mountain Peak

1
Christ upon the mountain peak
Stands alone in glory blazing;
Let us, if we dare to speak,
With the saints and angels praise Him:
Refrain:
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

2
Trembling at His feet we saw
Moses and Elijah speaking;
All the prophets and the law
Shout thro’ them their joyful greeting:
Refrain:
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

3
Swift the cloud of glory came,
God proclaiming in the thunder
Jesus as His Son by name;
Nations cry aloud in wonder!
Refrain:
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

4
This is God’s beloved Son:
Law and prophets fade before Him;
First and last, the only One,
Let creation now adore Him.

O Love, How Deep, How Broad
</title>
<lyric>
1
O love, how deep, how broad, how high,
Beyond all thought and fantasy,
That God, the Son of God, should take
Our mortal form for mortal’s sake!

2
For us baptized, for us He bore
His holy fast and hungered sore;
For us temptation sharp He knew;
For us the tempter overthrew.

3
For us by wickedness betrayed,
For us, in crown of thorns arrayed,
He bore the shameful cross and death;
For us He gave His dying breath.

4
For us He rose from death again,
For us He went on high to reign;
For us He sent His Spirit here
To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.

5
All glory to our Lord and God
For love so deep, so high, so broad;
The Trinity whom we adore
Forevermore and forevermore.

Once in Royal David's City
</title>
<lyric>
1
Once in royal David’s city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed;
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little Child.

2
He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall;
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
Lived on earth our Savior holy.

3
And through all His wondrous childhood
He would honor and obey,
Love and watch the lowly mother
In whose gentle arms He lay.
Christian children all must be
Mild, obedient, good as He.

4
And our eyes at last shall see Him,
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above;
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone.

At whose feet the shepherds fall?

At His feet we humbly fall,
Crown Him, crown Him Lord of all.
At His feet we humbly fall- the Lord of all.
Crown Him, crown Him, Jesus, Jesus,
Crown Him Lord of all.

2
Who is He in deep distress,
Fasting in the wilderness?

3
Who is He, the gathering throng
Greet with loud triumphant song?



4
Lo, at midnight, who is He
Prays in dark Gethsemane?

5
Who is He on yonder tree
Dies in shame and agony?

6
Who is He that from the grave
Comes to heal and help and save?

7
Who is He that from His throne
Rules through all the world alone?

Tell me the story of Jesus, Write on my heart every word, Tell me the story most precious Sweetest that ever was heard; Tell how the angels, in chorus, Sang as they welcomed His birth, Glory to God in the highest, Peace and good tidings to earth.


Refrain

Tell me the story of Jesus, Write on my heart every word, Tell me the story most precious, Sweetest that ever was heard.


2

Fasting, alone in the desert, Tell of the days that He passed,

How for our sins He was tempted, Yet was triumphant at last;

Tell of the years of His labor, Tell of the sorrow He bore, He was despised and afflicted, Homeless, rejected, and poor.


3
Tell of the cross where they nailed Him, Writhing in anguish and pain;

Tell of the grave where they laid Him, Tell how He liveth again;

Love in that story so tender, Clearer than ever I see;

Stay, let me weep while you whisper, Love paid the ransom for me.

Peace, I ask, but peace must be,

Chase these doubtings from my heart,
Now Thy perfect peace impart.

When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died; my richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride.


2

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, save in the death of Christ, my God; all the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood.


3

See, from his head, his hands, his feet, sorrow and love flow mingled down. Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown.


4

Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were an offering far too small; love so amazing, so divine,

demands my soul, my life, my all.

O sacred Head, now wounded,

with grief and shame weighed down, now scornfully surounded

with thorns, thine only crown: how pale thou art with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn!

How does that visage languish which once was bright as morn!


2

What thou, my Lord, has suffered was all for sinners' gain;

mine, mine was the transgression, but thine the deadly pain.

Lo, here I fall, my Savior! 'Tis I deserve thy place; look on me with thy favor, vouchsafe to me thy grace.

What language shall I borrow to thank thee, dearest friend, for this thy dying sorrow, thy pity without end?

O make me thine forever; and should I fainting be,

Shun not suffering, shame, or loss; learn of Christ to bear the cross.

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, the emblem of suffering and shame;

and I love that old cross where the dearest and best for a world of lost sinners was slain.


Refrain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross,

and exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, has a wondrous attraction for me;

for the dear Lamb of God left his glory above to bear it to dark Calvary.

To that old rugged cross I will ever be true, its shame and reproach gladly bear;

then he'll call me some day to my home far away, where his glory forever I'll share.

Throned upon the awful tree,
Lamb of God, Your grief we see.
Darkness veils Your anguished face;
None its lines of woe can trace.
None can tell what pangs unknown
Hold You silent and alone.

Silent through those three dread hours,
Wrestling with the evil powers,
Left alone with human sin,
Gloom around You and within,
Till th’appointed time is nigh,
Till the Lamb of God may die.

3
Hark, that cry that peals aloud
Upward through the whelming cloud!
You, the Father’s only Son,
You, His own anointed one,
You are asking- can it be?
“Why have You forsaken Me?”

Lord, should fear and anguish roll
Darkly o’er our sinful soul,
You, who once were thus bereft
That Your own might ne’er be left,
Teach us by that bitter cry
In the gloom to know You nigh.

There is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,

Who died to save us all.

But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there.

Saved by His precious blood.

To pay the price of sin;

Of heaven, and let us in.

And trust in His redeeming blood,
And try His works to do.

Now the queen of seasons, bright
With the day of splendor,
With the royal feast of feasts,
Comes its joy to render;
Comes to gladden faithful hearts
Which with true affection
Welcome in unwearied strain
Jesus’resurrection.

4
For today among the twelve
Christ appeared, be stowing
His deep peace, which evermore
Passes human knowing.
Neither could the gates of death,
Nor the tomb’s dark portal,
Nor the watchers, nor the seal,
Hold Him as a mortal.

5
“Alleluia!” now we cry
To our King immortal,
Who, triumphant, burst the bars
Of the tomb’s dark portal;
“Alleluia” with the Son,
God the Father praising;
“Alleluia!” yet again
To the Spirit raising.

Thine Is the Glory

<lyric>
1

Thine is the glory, Risen, conquering Son; Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won. Angels in bright raiment Rolled the stone away,

Kept the folded grave-clothes Where Thy body lay.


Refrain

Thine is the glory, Risen, conquering Son; Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won.


2

Lo! Jesus meets us. Risen from the tomb, Lovingly He greets us, Scatters fear and gloom;

Let His Church with gladness Hymns of triumph sing,

For her Lord now liveth; Death has lost its sting.


3
No more we doubt Thee, Glorious Prince of life! Life is nought without Thee; Aid us in our strife;

Make us more than conquerors, Through Thy deathless love; Bring us safe through Jordan To Thy home above.

Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,
What that in dark earth many days has lain;
Love lives again, that with the dead has been;
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

2
In the grave they laid Him, love by hatred slain,
Thinking that He would never wake again,
Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen;
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

3
Forth He came in triumph, like the risen grain,
He that for three days in the grave had lain;
Raised from the dead, my living Lord is seen;
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

4
When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,
Your touch can call us back to life again,
Field of our hearts that dead and bare have been;
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

My beauty are, my glorious dress;
Mid flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.

Bold shall I stand in that great day,
Cleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;
For by your cross absolved I am
From sin and guilt, from fear and shame.

3
Lord, I believe your precious blood,
Which at the mercy seat of God
Pleads for the captives’ liberty,
Was also shed in love for me.

To claim my mansion in the skies,
This then shall be my only plea:
Christ Jesus lived and died for me.

The Unveiled Christ

Once our blessed Christ of beauty
Was veiled off from human views;
But through suffering, death, and sorrow
He has rent the veil in two.

Refrain:
O behold the Man of Sorrows!
O behold Him in plain view!
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
Since her rent the veil in two;
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
Since her rent the veil in two.

2
Yes, He is with God, the Father,
Interceding there for you;
For He is the Well beloved
Since He rent the veil in two.

Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the mighty Conqueror
Since He rent the veil in two.

The Wonders of Redeeming Love
</title>
<lyric>
1
The wonders of redeeming love
Our highest thoughts exceed;
The Son of God comes from above
For sinful man to bleed.

2
He gives Himself, His life, His all,
A sinless sacrifice.
For man He drains the cup of gall,
For man the victim dies.

3
And now before His Father’s face
His precious blood He pleads;
For those who seek the throne of grace
His love still intercedes.

4
He knows the frailties of our frame,
For He has borne our grief;
Our great High Priest once felt the same,
And He can send relief.

5
His love will not be satisfied,
Till He in glory sees
The faithful ones for whom He died
From sin forever free.

O Listen to Our Wondrous Story

<lyric>
1
O listen to our wondrous story,
Counted once among the lost;
Yet One came down from heaven’s glory,
Saving us at awful cost!

Refrain:
Who saved us from eternal loss?
Who but God’s Son upon the cross?
What did He do? He died for you!
Where is He now? Believe it thou,
In heaven interceding! In heaven interceding!

2
No angel could His place have taken,
Highest of the high tho’ he;
The loved One on the cross forsaken
Was One of the Godhead three!

3
Will you surrender to this Savior?
To His scepter humbly bow?
You, too, shall come to know His favor,
He will save you, save you now.

Does Jesus Care?
</title>
<lyric>
1

Does Jesus care when my heart is pained Too deeply for mirth and song;

As the burdens press, and the cares distress, And the way grows weary and long?


Refrain

O yes, He cares- I know He cares! His heart is touched with my grief; When the days are weary,

The long nights dreary,

I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)


2

Does Jesus care when my way is dark With a nameless dread and fear?

As the daylight fades into deep night shades, Does He care enough to be near?


3

Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye To the dearest on earth to me,

And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks - Is it aught to Him? Does He see?

Christ is alive! Let Christians sing.
His cross stands empty to the sky.

Let streets and homes with praises ring. His love in death shall never die.


2

Christ is alive! No longer bound

To distant years in Palestine,

He comes to claim the here and now And conquer every place and time.


3

In every insult, rift, and war

Where color, scorn or wealth divide, He suffers still, yet loves the more, And lives, though ever crucified.


4

Christ is alive! Ascended Lord

He rules the world His Father made, Till, in the end, His love adored Shall be to all on earth displayed.

Sing of Him,who first loved me; for He left bright worlds above, And died on Calvary.

Endless praise my heart shall give; He has died that I might live

I will sing His love to me.


2

O the depths of love divine! Earth or heaven can never know How that sin as dark as mine can be made as white as snow.

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;

Sin had left a crimson stain; He washed it white as snow.


2

Lord, now indeed I find Thy power, and Thine alone, Can change the leper's spots, And melt the heart of stone.


3

Since nothing good have I Whereby Thy grace to claim, I'll wash my garment white

In the blood of Calvary's Lamb.

And when before the throne I stand in Him complete,
I'll lay my trophies down, All down at Jesus' feet.

Jesus is all the world to me, my life, my joy, my all;

he is my strength from day to day, without him I would fall.

When I am sad, to him I go, no other one can cheer me so;

when I am sad, he makes me glad, he's my friend.


2

Jesus is all the world to me, my friend in trials sore;

I go to him for blessings, and he gives them o'er and o'er.

He sends the sunshine and the rain, he sends the harvest's golden grain; sunshine and rain, harvest of grain, he's my friend.


3

Jesus is all the world to me, and true to him I'll be;

O how could I this friend deny, when he's so true to me? Following him I know I'm right, he watches o'er me day and night;
following him by day and night, he's my friend.


4

Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend;

I trust him now, I'll trust him when life's fleeting days shall end. Beautiful life with such a friend, beautiful life that has no end; eternal life, eternal joy,
he's my friend.

I've Found a Friend
</title>
<lyric>
1

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! He loved me ere I knew Him;

He drew me with the cords of love, And thus He bound me to Him.

And 'round my heart still closely twine Those ties which nought can sever, For I am His, and He is mine, Forever and forever.


2

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! He bled, He died to save me;

And not alone the gift of life, But His own self He gave me. Nought that I have my own I call, I hold it for the Giver;

My heart, my strength, my life my all, Are His, and His forever.


3

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! All power to Him is given;

To guard me on my upward course, And bring me safe to heaven.

The eternal glories gleam afar, To nerve my faint endeavor;
So now to watch, to work, to war, And then to rest forever.


4

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! So kind, and true, and tender,

So wise a counselor and guide, So mighty a defender.

From Him, who loveth me so well, What power my soul can sever? Shall life or death, or earth, or hell? No; I am His forever.

Jesus, What a Friend for Sinners

Jesus! what a Friend for sinners!
Jesus! Lover of my soul;
Friends may fail me, foes assail me,
He, my Savior, makes me whole.

Hallelujah! what a Savior!
Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
He is with me to the end.

Let me hide myself in Him.
Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing,
He, my Strength, my victory wins.

Jesus! what a Help in sorrow!
While the billows over me roll,
Even when my heart is breaking,
He, my Comfort, helps my soul.

[or Jesus! I do now adore Him,]
More than all in Him I find.
He hath granted me forgiveness,
I am His, and He is mine.

My Song Is Love Unknown
</title>
<lyric>
1
My song is love unknown,
My Savior’s love to me,
Love to the loveless shown,
That they might lovely be.
O who am I that for my sake
My Lord should take frail flesh and die?

2
He came from His blest throne,
Salvation to bestow,
But men made strange, and none
The longed for Christ would know.
But O my Friend, my Friend indeed
Who at my need His life did spend.

3
Sometimes they strew His way,
And His sweet praises sing,
Resounding all the day,
Hosannas to their King.
Then “Crucify” is all their breath,
And for His death they thirst and cry.

4
Why, what hath my Lord done?
What makes this rage and spite?
He made the lame to run,
He gave the blind their sight.
Sweet injuries! yet they at these
Themselves displease, and ‘gainst Him rise.

5
They rise, and needs will have
My dear Lord made away;
A murderer they save,
The Prince of life they slay.
Yet cheerful He to suff’ring goes,
That He His foes from thence might free.

6
Here might I stay and sing,
No story so divine:
Never was love, dear King,
Never was grief like Thine!
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise
I all my days could gladly spend.

Let us all in thee inherit; let us find that second rest.

Take away our bent to sinning; Alpha and Omega be;

end of faith, as its beginning, set our hearts at liberty.

Come, Almighty to deliver, let us all thy life receive; suddenly return and never, nevermore thy temples leave.

Thee we would be always blessing, serve thee as thy hosts above,
pray and praise thee without ceasing, glory in thy perfect love.

Finish, then, thy new creation; pure and spotless let us be. Let us see thy great salvation perfectly restored in thee; changed from glory into glory, till in heaven we take our place,

till we cast our crowns before thee, lost in wonder, love, and praise.

Sing we of the modern city,
Scene alike of joy and stress;
Sing we of its nameless people
In their urban wilderness.
Into endless rows of houses
Life is set a millionfold,
Life expressed in human beings
Daily born and growing old.

2
In the city full of people,
World of speed and hectic days,
In the ever-changing setting
Of the latest trend and craze,
Christ is present, and among us;
In the crowd we see Him stand.
In the bustle of the city
Jesus Christ is every man.

3
God is not remote in heaven,
But on earth to share our shame,
Changing graph and mass and number
Into persons with a name.
Christ has shown, beyond statistics,
Human life with glory crowned,
By His timeless presence proving
People matter, people count!

In any time of trouble, A comforter to me.

Tell me the old, old story: &quot;Christ Jesus makes thee whole.&quot;

that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?


Refrain

Amazing love! How can it be

that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?


2

He left his Father's throne above so free, so infinite his grace!; emptied himself of all but love, and bled for Adam's helpless race. 'Tis mercy all, immense and free, for O my God, it found out me!


3

Long my imprisoned sprit lay, fast bound in sin and nature's night;
thine eye diffused a quickening ray;

I woke, the dungeon flamed with light; my chains fell off, my heart was free, I rose, went forth, and followed thee.

No condemnation now I dread; Jesus, and all in him, is mine; alive in him, my living Head,

and clothed in righteousnes divine, bold I approach th' eternal throne,

and claim the crown, through Christ my own.

And heaven’s eternal light.

The joy of all who dwell above,
The joy of all below,
To whom He manifests His love,
And grants His name to know.

To them the cross, with all its shame,
With all its grace is given;
Their name an everlasting name,
Their joy the joy of heaven.

Tell it to every kindred and nation,
Tell it far and near;
Earth’s darkest night will fade with the dawning,
Jesus will soon appear.

Refrain:
Hail Him the King of glory,
Once the Lamb for sinners slain;
Tell, tell the wondrous story,
“Jesus comes to reign.”

2
Nations again in strife and commotion,
Warnings by the way;
Signs in the heavens, unerring omens,
Herald the glorious day.

3
Children of God look up with rejoicing;
Shout and sing His praise;
Blessèd are they who, waiting and watching,
Look for the dawning rays.

This Is the Threefold Truth
</title>
<lyric>
1
This is the threefold truth
On which our faith depends;
And with this joyful cry
Worship begins and ends;
Refrain:
Christ has died!
Christ is risen!
Christ will come again!

2
By this we are upheld
When doubt and grief assails
Our Christian fortitude,
And only grace avails.
Refrain:
Christ has died!
Christ is risen!
Christ will come again!

3
This is the threefold truth
Which, if we hold it fast,
Changes the world and us
And brings us home at last.
Refrain:
Christ has died!
Christ is risen!
Christ will come again!

Come, thou long expected Jesus!
born to set thy people free;
from our fears and sins release us,
let us find our rest in thee.
Israel’s strength and consolation,
hope of all the earth thou art;
dear desire of every nation,
joy of every longing heart.

Born thy people to deliver,
born a child and yet a King,
born to reign in us forever,
now thy gracious kingdom bring.
By thine own eternal spirit
rule in all our hearts alone;
by thine all sufficient merit,
raise us to thy glorious throne.

The golden morning is fast approaching;
Jesus soon will come
To take his faithful and happy children

Down the flaming sky

Face to face with Christ my Savior,
Face to face, what will it be,
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ, who died for me?

Refrain:
Face to face shall I behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory
I shall see Him by and by!

Only faintly now I see Him,
With the darkening veil between,
But a blessed day is coming,
When His glory shall be seen.

What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain;
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain!

Face to face! oh, blissful moment!
Face to face to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ, who loves me so.

To receive from the world His own.

No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying,
Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,

That glorious day is coming,
The hour is hastening on;
Its radiant light is nearing,
Far brighter than the sun;
In yonder clouds of heaven,
The Saviour will appear,
And gather all His chosen,
To meet Him in the air.
The saints, then all victorious
Will go to meet their Lord;
An earth both bright and glorious,
Will then be their reward;
And God Himself there reigning,
Will wipe all tears away;
Nor clouds nor night remaining,
But one eternal day.

2
O Christian, keep from sleeping,
And let your love abound;
Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,
The trumpet soon will sound!
O sinner, hear the warning!
To Jesus quickly fly!
Then you, in that blest morning,
May meet Him in the sky!

Wake, awake, for night is flying,
The watchmen on the heights are crying,
Awake, Jerusalem, arise!
Midnight’s solemn hour is tolling,
His chariot wheels are nearer rolling,
He comes; prepare, ye virgins wise.
Rise up with willing feet
Go forth, the Bridegroom meet; Alleluia!
Bear through the night your well-trimmed light,
Speed forth to join the marriage rite.

2
Zion hears the watchmen singing,
Her heart with deep delight is springing,
She wakes, she rises from her gloom;
Forth her Bridegroom comes, all-glorious,
In grace arrayed, by truth victorious;
Her Star is risen, her Light is come!
All hail, incarnate Lord,
Our crown, and our reward! Alleluia!
We haste along, in pomp and song,
And gladsome join the marriage throng.

3
Lamb of God, the heavens adore Thee,
And men and angels sing before Thee,
With harp and cymbal’s clearest tone.
By the pearly gates in wonder
We stand, and swell the voice of thunder,
That echoes round Thy dazzling throne.
No vision ever brought,
No ear hath ever caught,
Such bliss and joy;
We raise the song, we swell the throng,
To praise Thee ages all along.

Robed in dreadful majesty!

Heaven and earth shall flee away;

Hear the summons of that day-

To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps,
To look for the breaking of the day.

And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt, and blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the day.

And the glory of His resurection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather

Let us labor for the Master

Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care,
Then, when all of life is over,

And the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.

Will reach with mighty sound
Into the deepest quarters
Of all creation round;
And at this wondrous greeting
The dead in Christ shall rise,
Their Lord and Saviour meeting
In glory in the skies.

And His appearing love,
Shall know we are receiving

Will raise us to the place
Where we that wondrous hour
Shall see Him face to face.

The trumpet sound afar;
They people all are yearning
To be Thy raptured bride,

But downward bend his wondering eye
At mysteries so great.

With the banner of Christ unfurled,
That the light of the glorious gospel of truth
May shine throughout the world:
Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin
To set their captives free,
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

All we can do is nothing worth
Unless God blesses the deed;
Vainly we hope for the harvest tide
Till God gives life to teh seed;

As the waters cover the sea.

“Tis the Father’s pleasure we should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning was the mighty Word.

2
At His voice creation sprang at once to sight,
All the angel faces, All the hosts of light,
Thrones and dominations stars upon their way,
All the heavenly orders in their great array.

3
Humbled for a season, To receive a name
From the lips of sinners, Unto whom He came;
He is God the Savior, He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshiped, Trusted and adored.

4
In your hearts enthrone Him: There let Him subdue
All that is not holy, All that is not true;
Crown Him as your captain in temptation’s hour,
Let His will enfold you in its light and power.

5
Surely, this Lord Jesus shall return again,
With His Father’s glory, With His angel train;
For all wreaths of empire meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him King of glory now.

Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies
</title>
<lyric>
1
Christ, whose glory fills the skies,
Christ, the true, the only light,
Sun of Righteousness, arise,
triumph o’er the shades of night;
Dayspring from on high, be near;
Daystar, in my heart appear.

2
Dark and cheerless is the morn
unaccompanied by thee;
joyless is the day’s return,
till thy mercy’s beams I see;
till they inward light impart,
cheer my eyes and warm my heart.

3
Visit then this soul of mine;
pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
fill me, Radiancy divine,
scatter all my unbelief;
more and more thyself display,
shining to the perfect day.

Christ Is the World's Light

<lyric>
1
Christ is the world’s light,
Christ and none other;
born in our darkness,
He became our brother-
if we have seen Him,
we have seen the Father:
Glory to God on high!

2
Christ is the world’s peace,
Christ and none other;
no one can serve Him,
and despise another.
Who else unites us,
one in God the Father?
Glory to God on high!

3
Christ is the world’s life,
Christ and none other;
sold once for silver,
murdered here, our brother-
He, who redeems us,
reigns with God the Father:
Glory to God on high!

4
Give God the glory,
God and none other;
give God the glory,
Spirit, Son and Father;
give God the glory,
God-with-us our brother:
Glory to God on high!

1
Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ the head and cornerstone,
chosen of the Lord, and precious,
binding all the Church in one;
holy Zion’s help for ever,
and her confidence alone.

2
All that dedicated city,
dearly loved of God on high,
in exultant jubilation
pours perpetual melody;
God the One in Three adoring
in glad hymns eternally.

3
To this temple, where we call thee,
come, O Lord of Hosts, today;
with thy wonted loving-kindness
hear thy servants as they pray,
and thy fullest benediction
shed within its walls alway.

4
Here vouchsafe to all thy servants
what they ask of thee of gain;
what they gain from thee, for ever
with the blessèd to retain,
and hereafter in thy glory
evermore with thee to reign.

5
Laud and honor to the Father,
laud and honor to the Son,
laud and honor to the Spirit,
ever Three, and ever One,
con-substantial, co-eternal,
while unending ages run.

In the cross of Christ I glory,
towering o’er the wrecks of time;

hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
never shall the cross forsake me.
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

When the sun of bliss is beaming
light and love upon my way,
from the cross the radiance streaming
adds more luster to the day.

Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
by the cross are sanctified;
peace is there that knows no measure,
joys that through all time abide.

How Sweet the Name!

1
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.

2
It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
“Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary, rest.

3
Dear name, the rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place,
My neverfailing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace.

4
Jesus! my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest, and King!
My Lord, my life, my way, my end!
Accept the praise I bring.

5
Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I’ll praise Thee as I ought.

Jesus, priceless Treasure, Source of purest pleasure, Truest Friend to me:
Ah! how long I’ve panted, And my heart has fainted, thirsting, Lord, for Thee.
Thine I am, O spotless Lamb, I will suffer naught to hide Thee,
Nought I ask beside Thee.

2
In Thine arms I rest me; foes who would molest me Cannot reach me here.
Though the earth be shaking, Every heart be quaking, Jesus calms our fear.
Sin and hell in conflict fell, With their bitter storms assail me,
Jesus will not fail me.

3
Hence, all thought of sadness! For the Lord of gladness, Jesus, enters in.
Those who love the Father, Though the storms may gather, still have peace within;
Yea, whatever we here must bear, Still in Thee lies purest pleasure,
Jesus, priceless Treasure!

To reach the blissful kingdom
Of pure and perfect day:

That realm of splendor fair,
A song of praise to Jesus

I Cannot Tell Why
</title>
<lyric>
1
I cannot tell why He whom angels worship
Should set His love upon the souls of men,
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers,
To bring them back, they know not
how nor when.
But this I know, that He was born of Mary
When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home,
And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured;
And so the Saviour, Saviour of the world, has come.

2
I cannot tell how silently He suffered
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,
Nor how His heart upon the cross was broken,
The crown of pain to three and thirty years.
But this I know He heals the broken hearted
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear,
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden;
For still the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is here.



3
I cannot tell how He will win the nations,
How He will claim His earthly heritage,
How satisfy the needs and aspirations
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.
But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,
And some glad day His sun will shine in splendour
When He the Saviour, Saviour, of the world, is known.

4
I cannot tell how all lands shall worship,
When at His biding every storm is stilled,
Or who can say how great the jubilation
When all our hearts with love for Him are filled.
But this I know the skies shall sound His praises,
Ten thousand thousand human voices sing,
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth will answer,
At last the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is King!

They hailed the dawning Word,
And in the coming of the light
Proclaimed the coming Lord.

The prophets passed; at length there came
To sojourn and abide,
The Word incarnate, to whose name
The prophets testified;
And He, the twilight overpast,
Himself, the Light of light,
As man with man, revealed at last
The Father to our sight.

Eternal Spirit, who dost speak
To mind and conscience still,
That we in this our day, may seek
To do our Father’s will,
To us the word of life impart,
Of Christ, the living way;
Give us the quiet, humble heart
To hear and to obey.

Sweet Holy Spirit,
Sweet Heavenly Dove,

Stay right here with us,
Filling us with Your love,
And for these blessings
We lift our hearts in praise,
Without a doubt we’ll know
That we have been revived
When we shall leave this place.

Fire of God, Thou Sacred Flame

<lyric>
1
Fire of God, Thou sacred flame,
Spirit who in splendor came,
Let Thy heat my soul refine
Till it glows with love divine.

2
Breath of God, that swept in power
In the pentecostal hour,
Holy Breath, be Thou in me
Source of vital energy.

3
Strength of God, Thy might within
Conquers sorrow, pain, and sin:
Fortify from evil’s art
All the gateways of my heart.

4
Truth of God, Thy piercing rays
Penetrate my secret ways.
May the light that shames my sin
Guide me holier paths to win.

5
Love of God, Thy grace profound
Knoweth neither age nor bound:
Come, my heart’s own guest to be,
Dwell forevermore in me.

O for That Flame of Living Fire
</title>
<lyric>
1
O for that flame of living fire
Which shone so bright in saints of old;
Which bade their souls to heaven aspire,
Calm in distress, in danger bold!

2
Where is that spirit, Lord, which dwelt
In Abram’s breast, and sealed Him Thine?
Which made Paul’s heart with sorrow melt,
And glow with energy divine?

3
That spirit which from age to age
Proclaimed Thy love, and taught Thy ways?
Brightened Isaiah’s vivid page,
And breathed in David’s hallowed lays?

4
Is not Thy grace as mighty now
As when Elijah felt its power?
When glory beamed from Moses’ brow,
Or Job endured the trying hour?

5
Remember, Lord, the ancient days;
Renew Thy work, Thy grace restore;
And while to Thee our hearts we raise,
On us Thy Holy Spirit pour.

Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;
wean it from earth; through all its pulses move;
stoop to my weakness, mighty as thou art,
and make me love thee as I ought to love.

2
I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies,
no sudden rending of the veil of clay,
no angel visitant, no opening skies;
but take the dimness of my soul away.

3
Has thou not bid me love thee, God and King?
All, all thine own, soul, heart and strength and mind.
I see thy cross; there teach my heart to cling.
O let me seek thee, and O let me find.

4
Teach me to feel that thou art always nigh;
teach me the struggles of the soul to bear.
To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh,
teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.

5
Teach me to love thee as thine angels love,
one holy passion filling all my frame;
the kindling of the heaven-descended Dove,
my heart an altar, and thy love the flame.

Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.

Though we rebelled, You gently sought again,

To sinful hearts Your justice and Your grace;
And questing mortals longing for Your healing,
See Your compassion in the Savior’s face.

Through all the earth, to ever land and race,
That myriad tongues, in one great anthem blending,
May praise and celebrate Your gift of grace.

We have not served Thee as we ought;
Alas! the duties left undone,
The work with little fervor wrought,
The battles lost, or scarcely won!

There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;
Would you o’er evil a victory win?
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

Refrain:
There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder working pow’r
In the blood of the Lamb;
There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder working pow’r
In the precious blood of the Lamb.

2
Would be free from your passion and pride?
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;
Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide?
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

3
Would you do service for Jesus your King?
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood;
Would you live daily His praises to sing?
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

Chief of Sinners
</title>
<lyric>
1
Chief of sinners though I be,
Jesus shed His blood for me;
Died that I might live on high,
Died that I might never die;
As the brance is to the vine,
I am His, and He is mine.

2
O the height of Jesus’ love!
Higher than the heaven above,
Deeper than the deepest sea,
Lasting as eternity;
Love that found me-wondrous thought!
Found me when I sought Him not!

3
Chief of sinners though I be,
Christ is all in all to me;
All my wants to Him are known,
All my sorrows are His own;
Safe with Him from earthly strife,
He sustains the hidden life.

I’ve wandered far away from God,
Now I’m coming home;
The paths of sin too long I’ve trod;
Lord, I’m coming home.

Coming home, coming home
Never more to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord I’m coming home.

I’ve wasted many precious years,
Now I’m coming home;
I now repent with bitter tears;

I’ll trust thy love belive thy word;

Now I’m coming home;
That Jesus died, and died for me;
Lord I’m coming home.

Now I’m coming home;
O wash me whiter than the snow;
Lord I’m coming home.

God, be merciful to me,
On Thy grace I rest my plea;
Plenteous in compassion Thou,
Blot out my transgressions now;
Wash me, make me pure within,
Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin,
Wash me, make me pure within,
Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin.

2
I am evil, born in sin;
Thou desirest truth within.
Thou alone my Savior art,
Teach Thy wisdom to my heart;
Make me pure, Thy grace bestow,
Wash me whiter than the snow,
Make me pure, Thy grace bestow,
Wash me whiter than the snow.

3
Gracious God, my heart renew,
Make my spirit right and true;
Cast me not away from Thee,
Let Thy Spirit dwell in me;
Thy salvation’s joy impart,
Steadfast make my willing heart,
Thy salvation’s joy impart,
Steadfast make my willing heart.

4
Sinners then shall learn from me
And return, O God, to Thee;
Savior, all my guilt remove,
And my tongue shall sing Thy love;
Touch my silent lips, O Lord,
And my mouth shall praise accord,
Touch my silent lips, O Lord,

I Lay My Sins on Jesus

I lay my sins on Jesus,
The spotless Lamb of God;
He bears them all, and frees us
From the accursed load,
From the accursed load.

2
I bring my guilt to Jesus,
To wash my crimson stains
White in His blood most precious
Till not a stain remains,
Till not a stain remains.

3
I lay my wants on Jesus,
All fullness dwells in Him;
He healeth my diseases
He doth my soul redeem,
He doth my soul redeem



4
I long to be with Jesus,
Meek, loving, lowly, mild;
I long to be like Jesus
The Father’s holy child,
The Father’s holy child.

5
I long to be with Jesus
Amid the heav’nly throng,
To sing with them His praises,
And learn the angels’ song.
And learn the angels’ song.

Forgive Our Sins as We Forgive

<lyric>
1
“Forgive our sins as we forgive,”
You taught us, Lord, to pray;
But You alone can grant us grace
To live the words we say.

2
How can Your pardon reach and bless
The unforgiving heart
That broods on wrongs and will not let
Old bitterness depart?

3
In blazing light Your cross reveals
The truth we dimly knew:
How trifling others’ debts to us;
How great our debt to You!

4
Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls
And bid resentment cease;
Then, by Your mercy reconciled,
Our lives will spread Your peace.

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

2
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

When my pilgrimage I close;
Victor o’er the last of foes,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.

Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
Nought as an offering to Jesus my King-
Only my sinful now contrite heart,
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,

Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine;
Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last;
Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
Through endless ages, ever to be,
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,

While in this world of sin;
But to pray I’ll not cease
Till I am pure within.

Beneath the Cross of Jesus

<lyric>
1
Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
the shadow of a mighty rock
within a weary land;
a home within the wilderness,
a rest upon the way,
from the burning of the noontide heat,
and the burden of the day.

2
Upon that cross of Jesus
mine eye at times can see
the very dying form of One
who suffered there for me;
and from my stricken heart with tears
two wonders I confess:
the wonders of redeeming love
and my unworthiness.

3
I take, O cross, thy shadow
for my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
the sunshine of his face;
content to let the world go by,
to know no gain nor loss,
my sinful self my only shame,
my glory all the cross.

In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;

Whenever we hear that glorious Word!
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children’s fate.
If they, like them, could die for thee!
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.

Let the world despise and leave me, they have left my Savior, too.
Human hearts and looks deceive me; Thou art faithful, Thou art true.
O, ‘tis not in grief to harm me, while thy love is left to me;
O, ‘twere not in joy to charm me, If that love be hid from me.

3
Soul, then know thy full salvation; rise o’er sin, and fear, and care;
Joy to find in every station something still to do or bear:
Think what Spirit dwells within thee; Think what Father’s smiles are thine;
Think that Jesus died to win thee, child of heaven, canst thou repine?

4
Haste then on from grace to glory, armed by faith, and winged by prayer,
Heaven’s eternal day’s before thee, God’s own hand shall guide thee there.
Soon shall close thy earthly mission, soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;
Hope soon change to glad fruition, faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

Open My Eyes That I May See
</title>
<lyric>
1
Open my eyes, that I may see
Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
Place in my hands the wonderful key
That shall unclasp and set me free.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes,
illumine me, Spirit Divine!

2
Open my ears that I may hear
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
and while the wavenotes fall on my ear,
Everything false will disappear.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my ears, illumine me, Spirit Divine!

3
Open my mouth, and let me bear
Gladly the warm truth everywhere;
Open my heart, and let me prepare
Love with Thy children thus to share.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my heart, illumine me, Spirit Divine!

I'd Rather Have Jesus

<lyric>
1
I’d rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
I’d rather be His than have riches untold;
I’d rather have Jesus than houses or land;
I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand:

Refrain:
Than to be the king of a vast domain or be held in sin’s dread sway!
I’d rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.

2
I’d rather have Jesus than men’s applause;
I’d rather be faithful to His dear cause;
I’d rather have Jesus than world-wide fame;
I’d rather be true to His holy name:

3

He’s sweeter than honey from out the comb;
He’s all that my hungering spirit needs -
I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead:

Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
and all the world go free?
No, there’s a cross for everyone,
and there’s a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I’ll bear
till He shall set me free;
and then go home my crown to wear,
for there’s a crown for me.

Upon the crystal pavement, down
at Jesus’ pierced feet,
with joy I’ll cast my golden crown,
and His dear name repeat.

At Thy feet its treasure store;

With heart made pure and garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

Announces that the Lord is nigh;
Awake and hearken, for he brings
Glad tidings of the King of kings!

Make straight the way for God within,
And let us all our hearts prepare
For Christ to come and enter there.

Tune my heart to sing thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me ever to adore Thee,

While the hope of endless glory
Fills my heart with joy and love.

Here I raise mine Ebenezer;
Hither by thy help I’ve come;
And I hope, by thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed his precious blood.

O, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I’m constrained to be!
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind me closer still to thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart–O, take and seal it,
Seal it for thy courts above.

There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel’s veins;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.
Lose all their guilty stains, lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.
Wash all my sins away, wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.

3
Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious blood shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God are saved, to sin no more.
Are saved, to sin no more, are saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God are saved, to sin no more.

4
E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.
And shall be till I die, and shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.
5
Lord, I believe Thou hast prepared, unworthy though I be,
For me a blood-bought free reward, a golden harp for me!
A golden harp for me! A golden harp for me!
For me a blood-bought free reward, a golden harp for me!

6
There in a nobler, sweeter song, I’ll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the the grave.
Is ransomed from the grave, is ransomed from the grace;
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the the grave.

Is this a day of new beginnings,
Time to remember and move on,
Time too believe what love is bringing,
Laying to rest the pain that’s gone?

How can the seasons of a planet
Mindlessly spinning round its sun
With just a human name and number
Say that some new thing has begun?

3
Yet through the life and death of Jesus
Love’s mighty Spirit, now as then,
Can make for us a world of difference
As faith and hope are born again.

4
Then let us, with the Spirit’s daring,
Step from the past and leave behind
Its disappointment, guilt, and grieving,
Seeking new paths, and sure to find.
5
Christ is alive, and goes before us
To show and share what love can do.
This is a day of new beginnings;
Our God is making all things new.

Built on the Rock the Church shall stand,
Even when steeples are falling;
Crumbled have spires in every land,
Bells still are chiming and calling
Calling the young and old to rest,
Calling the souls of those distressed,
Longing for life everlasting.

2
Not in our temples made with hands
God, the Almighty, is dwelling;
High in the heav’ns His temple stands,
All earthly temples excelling.
Yet He who dwells in heav’n above
Deigns to abide with us in love,
Making our bodies His temple.

3
We are God’s house of living stones,
Built for His own habitation;
He fills our hearts, His humble thrones,
Granting us life and salvation.
Were two or three to seek His face,
He in their midst would show His grace,
Blessings upon them bestowing.

4
Yet in this house, an earthly frame,
Jesus His children is blessing;
Hither we come to praise His name,
Faith in our Savior confessing.
Jesus to us His Spirit sent,
Making with us His covenant,
Granting His children the kingdom.

5
Thro‘ all the passing years, O Lord,
Grant that, when church bells are ringing,
Many may come to hear God’s Word
Where He this promise is bringing:

The church’s one foundation
is Jesus Christ her Lord;

by water and the Word.
From heaven he came and sought her
to be his holy bride;
with his own blood he bought her,
and for her life he died.

2
Elect from every nation,
yet one o’er all the earth;
her charter of salvation,
one Lord, one faith, one birth;
one holy name she blesses,
partakes one holy food,
and to one hope she presses,
with every grace endued.

3
Though with a scornful wonder
we see her sore oppressed,
by schisms rent asunder,
by heresies distressed,
yet saints their watch are keeping;
their cry goes up, “How long?”
And soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song.

4
‘Mid toil and tribulation,
and tumult of her war,
she waits the consummation
of peace forevermore;
till, with the vision glorious,
her longing eyes are blest,
and the great church victorious
shall be the church at rest.

And all seemed sunk in night,

And this was still their message:
One church, one faith, one Lord.

The cup of water given for you still
holds the freshness of your grace;
yet long these multitudes to view
the sweet compassion of your face.

4
O Master, from the mountainside
make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
among these restless throngs abide;
O tread the city’s streets again.
5
Till all the world shall learn your love
and follow where your feet have trod,
till, glorious from your heaven above,
shall come the city of our God.

All Who Love and Serve Your City

<lyric>
1
All who love and serve your city,
All who bear its daily stress,
All who cry for peace and justice,
All who curse and all who bless.

2
In your day of loss and sorrow,
In your day of helpless strife,
Honor, peace, and love retreating,
Seek the Lord, who is your life.

3
For all days are days of judgment,
And the Lord is waiting still,
Drawing near His friends who spurn Him,
Off’ring peace from Calv’ry’s hill.

4
Risen Lord, shall yet the city
Be the city of despair?
Come today, our judge, our glory;
Be its name “The Lord is there!”

Come, labor on.
Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain
While all around him waves the golden grain?
And to each servant does the Master say,
“Go work today.”

2
Come, labor on.
Claim the high calling angels cannot share;
To young and old the gospel gladness bear;
Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.
The night draws nigh.

3
Come, labor on.
No time for rest; till glows the western sky,
Till the long shadows oér our pathway lie,
And a glad sound comes with the setting sun,
“Well done, well done!”

1
Far and near the fields are teeming
with the sheaves of ripened grain;
Far and near their gold is gleaming
O’er the summy slope and plain.

Refrain:
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
Hear us Lord,to Thee we cry;
Send them now the sheaves to gather,
Ere the harvest-time pass by.

2
Send them forth with morn’s first beaming,
Send them in the noon-tides’s glare;
When the sun’s last rays are streaming,
bid them gather everywhere.

3
O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,
gather now the sheaves of gold;
Heavenward then at evening wending
Thou shalt come with joy untold.

Hark! the Voice of Jesus Calling
</title>
<lyric>
1
Hark! the voice of Jesus calling,
“Who will go and work today?
Fields are white, the harvest waiting,
Who will bear the sheaves away?”
Loud and long the Master calleth,
Rich reward He offers free;
Who will answer, gladly saying,
“Here am I, O Lord, send me”?

2
If you cannot cross the ocean
And the heathen lands explore,
You can find the heathen nearer,
You can help them at your door;
If you cannot speak like angels,
If you cannot preach like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus,
You can say He died for all.

3
If you cannot be the watchman,
Standing high on Zion’s wall,
Pointing out the path to heaven,
Offering life and peace to all;
With your prayers and with your bounties
You can do what Heaven demands,
You can be like faithful Aaron,
Holding up the prophet’s hands.

4
While the souls of men are dying,
And the Master calls for you,
Let none hear you idly saying,
“There is nothing I can do!”
Gladly take the task He gives you,
Let His work your pleasure be;
Answer quickly when He calleth,
“Here am I, O Lord, send me.”

From the eastern mountains Pressing on they come,
Wise men in their wisdom, To His humble home;
Stirred by deep devotion, Hasting from afar,
Ever journeying onward, Guided by a star.

There their Lord and Savior Meek and lowly,
Wondrous light that led them Onward on their way,
Ever now to lighten Nations from afar,
As they journey homeward By that guiding star.

Gather in the outcasts All who’ve gone astray,
Throw Thy radiance o’er them, Guide them on their way;
Those who never knew Thee, Those who’ve wandered far,
Guide them by the brightness Of Thy guiding star.

Until every nation, Whether bond or free,
‘Neath Thy starlit banner, Jesus follows thee.
O’er the distant mountains To that heavenly home,

Bore the weight of human need,
Who upon the cross, forsaken,
Worked Your mercy’s perfect deed:

Not of voice alone, but heart;
Consecrating to Your purpose
Every gift which You impart.

Still Your children wander homeless;
Still the hungry cry for bread;
Still the captives long for freedom;
Still in grief we mourn our dead.
As you, Lord, in deep compassion
Healed the sick and freed the soul,
By Your Spirit send Your power
To our world to make it whole.

3
As we worship, grant us vision,
Till your love’s revealing light
In its height and depth and greatness
Dawns upon our quickened sight,
Making known the needs and burdens
Your compassion bids us bear,
Stirring us to ardent service,

With sickles of truth must the work be done,
And no one may rest till the “harvest home.”

Waiting for the harvest and the time of reaping -

Fearing neither clouds nor winter’s chilling breeze;

Tho the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
When our weeping’s over He will bid us welcome -

Lift Him up, ’tis He that bids you,
Let the dying look and live;
To all weary, thirsting sinners,
Living waters will He give;
And though once so meek and lowly,
Yet the Prince of heaven was He;
And the blind, who grope in darkness,
Through the blood of Christ shall see.

Refrain:
Lift Him up, the risen Savior,
High amid the waiting throng;
Lift Him up, ’tis He that speaketh,
Now He bids you flee from wrong.

Lift Him up, this precious Savior,
Let the multitude behold;
They with willing hearts shall seek Him,
He will draw them to His fold;
They shall gather from the wayside,
Hastening on with joyous feet,
They shall bear the cross of Jesus,
And shall find salvation sweet.

3
Lift Him up in all His glory,
‘Tis the Son of God on high;
Lift Him up, His love shall draw them,
Eén the careless shall draw nigh;
Let them hear again the story
Of the cross, the death of shame;
And from tongue to tongue repeat it;
Mighty throngs shall bless His name.

4
O then lift Him up in singing,
Lift the Savior up in prayer;
He, the glorious Redeemer,
All the sins of men did bear;
Yes, the young shall bow before Him,
And the old their voices raise;
All the deaf shall hear hosannah;
And the dumb shall shout His praise.

How happy are our ears,

Which kings and prophets waited for,

But died without the sight!

And tuneful notes employ;

Wanderers on the mountain astray;

Bringing the wanderer back again, back again,
Into the fold (into the fold)

Seeking the lost and pointing to Jesus
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life evermore.

Following Christ from day unto day,
Cheering the faint and raising the fallen,
Pointing the lost to Jesus, the Way.

Under the sunset skies;
While their bright tints are glowing,

Across the fields of praise,
When earth’s first Sabbath made complete

The blessed Sabbath mood;
And in that green and golden world
Know all God’s works are good.

But now in our diminished lives
We sing a blemished song;
The earth is worn and disarrayed
And all our work goes wrong.

Still in our worship,
Joining in praise and fellowship,
By Sabbath radiance blessed,
We put our doubt and fear away
And rest within God’s rest.

And arching over time and space
The Lord of Sabbaths wills
Renewal for the weary earth
And healing for our ills.

We know and shall be known.
With hosts of the redeemed we’ll sing
Around God’s shining throne.

Of all the week the brightest,
Of all the week the best;
It brings repose from labor,
It tells of joy divine,
Its beams of light descending,
With heavenly beauty shine.

Refrain:
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
Blessed Sabbath day,
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
Blessed Sabbath day.

2
Keep the Sabbath holy,
And worship Him today,
Who said to His disciples,
“I am the living way;”
And if we meekly follow
Our Savior here below,
He’ll give us of the fountain
Whose streams eternal flow.

3
Day of sacred pleasure!
Its golden hours we’ll spend
In thankful hymns to Jesus,
The children’s dearest Friend;
O gentle loving, Savior,
How good and kind Thou art,
How precious is Thy promise
To dwell in every heart!

Lord God, Your Love Has Called Us Here

1
Lord God, Your love has called us here,
As we, by love, for love were made.
Your living likeness still we bear
Tho’ marred, dishonored, disobeyed.
We come, with all our heart and mind
Your call to hear, Your love to find.

2
We come with self inflicted pains
Of broken trust and chosen wrong,
Half free, half bound by inner chains,
By social forces swept along,
By powers and systems close confined,
Yet seeking hope for human kind.

3
Lord God, in Christ You call our name,
And then receive us as Your own,
Not thro’ some merit, right, or claim,
But by Your gracious love alone.
We strain to glimpse Your mercy seat,
And find You kneeling at our feet.
4
Then take the towel, and break the bread,
And humble us, and call us friends.
Suffer and serve till all are fed
And show how grandly love intends
To work till all creation sings,
To fill all worlds, to crown all things.

5
Lord God, in Christ You set us free
Your life to live, Your joy to share.
Give us Your Spirit’s liberty
To turn from guilt and dull despair
And offer all that faith can do,
While love is making all things new.

For those loved until the end:

To celebrate their risen Friend.

For service, too, is sacrament.
In Him our joy shall be made complete
Sent out to serve, as He was sent.

A lasting gift Jesus gave His own:
To share His bread, His loving cup.
Whatever burdens may bow us down,
He by His cross shall lift us up.

In every room in our Father’s house,

One sure faith yet standing fast,

To plead His blood for saints, and make
The last remembrance of their sin.

When we who have His name confessed,
Each in his lot must singly stand
And pass the final, searching test.

Confess our names before the throne,
And blot our sins from out Thy book.

We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

2
Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But children of the heav’nly King,
But children of the heav’nly King
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad.


3
The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Before we reach the heav’nly fields
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.

4
Then let our songs abound
And ev’ry tear be dry;
We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground,
We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high.

Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken
</title>
<lyric>
1
Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
He whose word cannot be broken
Formed thee for His own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation’s wall surrounded,
Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.

2
See the streams of living waters
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear and want remove;
Who can faint when such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,
Never fails from age to age.

3
Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear
For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is near;
Blest inhabitants of Zion,
Washed in the Redeemer’s blood;
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
Makes them kings and priests to God.

4
Savior, if of Zion’s city
I, through grace, a member am,
Let the world deride or pity,
I will glory in Thy name;
Fading is the worldling’s pleasure,
All his boasted pomp and show;
Solid joys and lasting treasure
None but Zion’s children know.

1
For thee, O dear country,
Mine eyes their vigils keep;
For very love beholding
Thy holy name, they weep.

2
O one, O only mansion!
O Paradise of joy!
Where tears are ever banish’d
And smiles have no alloy;

3
With jasper glow thy burwarks,
Thy streets with emeralds blaze;
The sardius and the topaz
Unite in thee their rays;

4
The cross is all thy splendor,
The Crucified thy praise;
His laud and benediction
Thy ransom’d saints shall raise;

O sweet and blessed country,
The home of God’s elect!
O sweet and blessed country
That eager hearts expect!

Holy, Holy, Is What the Angels Sing
</title>
<lyric>
1
There is singing up in heaven
such as we have never known,
Where the angels sing the praises
of the Lamb upon the throne;
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful
and their voices are always clear,
O that we might be more like them
while we serve the Master here!

Refrain:
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make
the courts of heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption’s story,
they will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys
that our salvation brings.

2
But I hear another anthem,
blending voices clear and strong,
“Unto Him who hath redeemed us
and hath bought us,” is the song;
We have come thro’ tribulations
to this land so fair and bright,
In the fountain freely flowing
He hath made our garments white.

3
Then the angels stand and listen,
for they cannot join that song,
Like the sound of many waters,
by that happy, blood-washed throng;
For they sing about great trials,
battles fought and vict’ries won,
And they praised the great Redeemer,
who hath said to them, “Well done.”

4
So, although I’m not an angel,
yet I know that over there
I will join a blessed chorus
that the angels cannot share;
I will sing about my Savior,
who upon dark Calvary
Freely pardoned my transgressions,
died to set the sinner free.

On that golden strand,
And with Him shall ever stay.

Refrain:
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
‘Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King someday.

2
In the land of song, in the glory throng,
Where there never comes a night,
With my Lord once slain I shall ever reign
In the glory land of light.

3
I shall see the King, all my tributes bring,
And shall look upon His face;
Then my song shall be how He ransomed me
And has kept me by His grace.

Lies “the city four-square;”

There’s no death, no pain, nor fears;
And they count not time by years,
For there is “no night there.”

2
All the gates of pearl are made,
In “the city four-square;”
All the streets with gold are laid,
And there is “no night there.”

3
And the gates shall never close
To “the city four-square;”
There life’s crystal river flows,
And there is “no night there.”
4
There they need no sunshine bright,
In “that city four-square;”
For the Lamb is all the light,
And there is “no night there.”

The melodious songs of the blest,

Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

And the blessings that hallow our days.

Jerusalem the golden,
With milk and honey blest,
Beneath thy contemplation
Sink heart and voice oppressed.
I know not, O I know not
What holy joys are there;
What radiancy of glory,
What bliss beyond compare.

2
They stand, those hall of Zion,
All jubilant with song,
And bright with many an angel,
And all the martyr throng.
The Prince is ever in them,
The daylight is serene;
The pastures of the blessed
Are deck in glorious sheen.

3
There is the throne of David,
And there, from care released,
The shout of them that triumph,
The song of them that feast;
And they who, with their Leader,
Have conquered in the fight,
Forever and forever
Are clad in robes of white.

4
O sweet and blessed country,
The home of God’s elect!
O sweet and blessed country,
That eager hearts expect!

To that dear land of rest;

Ten thousand times ten thousand,
In sparkling raiment bright,
The armies of the ransomed saints
Throng up the steeps of light.
‘Tis finished, all is finished,
Their fight with death and sin.
Fling open wide the golden gates,
And let the victors in.

2
What rush of hallelujahs
Fills all the earth and sky!
The ringing of a thousand harps
Proclaims the triumph high.
O day for which creation
And all its tribes were made!
O joy, for all its former woes
A thousandfold repaid!

3
O then what raptured greetings
On Canaan’s happy shore!
What knitting severed friendship where
Death partings are no more!
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle,
That brimmed with tears of late;
Orphans no longer fatherless,
Nor widows desolate.

4
Bring near Thy great salvation,
Thou Lamb for sinners slain,
Fill up the roll of Thine elect,
Then take Thy power and reign!

Thine exiles long for home;
Show in the heavens Thy promised sign;

We speak of the realms of the blest,
That country so bright and so fair,
And oft are its glories confessed-
But what must it be to be there!
We speak of its pathway of gold-
Its walls decked with jewels so rare,
Its wonders and pleasures untold-
But what must it be to be there!

2
We speak of its freedom of sin,
From sorrow, temptation and care,
From trials without and within—
But what must it be to be there!
We speak of its service of love,
Of the robes which glorified wear,
Of the church of the First Born above-
But what must it be to be there!

3
Our mourning is all at an end,
When, raised by the life-giving word,
We see the new city descend,
Adorned as a bride for her Lord;
The city so holy and clean,
No sorrow can breathe in the air;
No gloom of affliction or sin,
No shadow of evil, is there.

4
Do Thou, midst temptation and woe,
For heaven my spirit prepare;
And shortly I also so shall know
And feel what it is to be there.
Then o’er the bright fields we shall roam,
In glory celestial and fair,
With saints and with angels at home,
And Jesus Himself will be there.

With angels bright and fair;
There’s no sin in the homeland,

And when I think of the homeland

Are beckoning me to come,
Where neither death nor sorrow

How Far From Home?
</title>
<lyric>
1
How far from? I asked, as on
I bent my steps-the watchman spake:
“the long, dark night is almost gone,
The morning soon will break.
Then weep no more, but speed thy flight,
With Hope’s bright star guiding ray,
Till thou shalt reach the realms of light,
In everlasting days.”

2
I asked the warrior on the field;
This was his soul-inspiring song:
“With courage, bold, the sword I’ll wield,
The battle is not long.
Then weep no more, but well endure
The conflict, till thy work is done;
For this we know, the prize is sure,
When victory is won.”

3
I asked again; earth, sea, and sun
Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:
“Time’s wasting sands are nearly run,
Eternity is nigh.
Then weep no more-with warning tones,
Portentous signs are thickening round,
The whole creation, waiting, groans,
To hear the trumpet sound.”

4
Not far from home! O blessed thought!
The traveler’s lonely heart to cheer;
Which oft a healing balm has brought,
And dried the mourner’s tear.
Then weep no more, since we shall meet
Where weary footsteps never roam-
Our trails past, our joys complete,
Safe in our Father’s home.

I Saw One Weary

<lyric>
1
I saw one weary, sad, and torn,
With eager steps press on the way,
Who long the hallowed cross had born,
Still looking for the promised day;
While many a line of grief and care,
Upon his brow was furrowed there;
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,
“O this” said he-”the blessed hope.”

2
And one I saw, with sword and shield,
Who boldly braved the world’s cold frown,
And fought, unyielding, on the field,
To win an everlasting crown.
Though worn with toil, oppressed by foes,
No murmur from his heart arose;
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,
“O this!” said he-”the blessed hope.”

3
And there was one who left behind
The cherished friends of early years,
And honor, pleasure, wealth re-signed,
To tread the path bedewed with tears.
Through trials deep and conflict sore,
Yet still a smile of joy he wore;
O! what can bouy the spirit up?
‘Tis this alone-the blessed hope.

4
While pilgrims here we journey on
In this dark vale of sin and gloom,
Through tribulation, hate, and scorn,
Or through the portals of the tomb,
Till our returning King shall come
To tkae His exile captives home,
O! what can bouy the spirits up?
‘Tis this alone– the blessed hope.

And the millions that sleep in the mighty deep
Shall live on this earth once more.

Eden home, Sweet songs of redemption we’ll sing;
From the north, from the south, all the ransomed shall come,
And worship our heavenly King.

Long upon the mountains weary,
Have the scattered flocks been torn;
Dark the dessert paths, and dreary;

Now the gathering call is sounding,
Solemn in its warning voice;
Union, faith, and love, abounding,
Bid the little flock rejoice.

2
Now the light of truth they’re seeking,
In its onward track pursue;
All the ten commandments keeping,
They are holy, just, and true.
On the words of lire they’re feeding,
Precious to their taste so sweet;
All their Master’s percepts heeding,
Bowing humbly to His feet.

In that light of light and beauty,
In that golden city fair,
Soon its pearly gates they’ll enter,
And of all its glories share.
There, divine the soul’s expansions;
Free from sin, and death, and pain;
Tear will never dim those mansions
Where the souls immortal reign.

Soon He comes! With clouds descending;
All His saints, entombed arise;
The redeemed, in anthems blending,
Shout their vict’ry thro’ the skies.

Take thy ransomed children home.

Beautiful Zion, built above,
Beautiful city that I love,
Beautiful gates of pearly white,
Beautiful temple, God its light.

2
Beautiful trees forever there,
Beautiful fruit they always bear,
Beautiful rivers gliding by,
Beautiful fountains never dry.

3
Beautiful crowns on every brow,
Beautiful palms the conquerors show,
Beautiful robes the ransomed wear,
Beautiful all who enter there.

Together Let Us Sweetly Live
</title>
<lyric>
1
Together let us sweetly live,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
Together love to Jesus give;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

Refrain:
O Canaan, bright Canaan,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
O Canaan, it is my happy home,
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

2
Together let us watch and pray;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
And wait redemption’s joyous day;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

3
Our songs of praise shall fill the skies;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
While higher still our joys shall rise;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
4
Then come with me, beloved friend;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.
The joys to come shall never end;
I am bound for the land of Canaan.

What Heavenly Music
</title>
<lyric>
1
What heavenly music steals over the sea!
Entrancing the senses like sweet melody!
‘Tis the voice of the angels borne soft on the air;
For me they are singing; their welcome I hear.

2
On the banks of old Jordan, here gazing I stand,
And earnestly longing, I stretch forth my hand;
Send a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray!
Let me join that sweet music; come, take me away.

3
Though dark are the waters and rough is the wave,
If Jesus permit, the wild surges I’ll brave;
For that heavenly music hath ravished me so,
I must join in that chorus! I’ll go! let me go!

We Have Heard
</title>
<lyric>
1
We have heard from the bright, the holy, land;
We have heard, and our hearts are glad;
For we were a lonely pilgrim band,
And weary, and worn, and sad.
They tell us the saints have a dwelling there-
No longer are homeless ones;
And we know that the goodly land is fair,
Where life’s pure river runs.

2
They say green fields are waving there,
That never a blight shall know;
And the deserts wild are blooming fair,
And the roses of Sharon grow.
There are lovely birds in the bowers green,
Their songs are blithe and sweet;
And their warblings, gushing ever new,
The angels’ harpings greet.

3
We have heard of the palms, the robes, the crowns,
And the silvery band in white;
Of the city fair, with pearly gates,
All radiant with light.
We have heard of the angels there, and saints,
With their harps of gold, how they sing;
Of the mount with the fruitful tree of life,
Of the leaves that healing bring.

4
The King of that country, He is fair,
He’s the joy and light of the place;
In His beauty we shall behold Him there,
And bask in His smiling face,
We’ll be there, we’ll be there in a little while,
We’ll join the pure and the blest;
We’ll have the palm, the robe, the crown,
And forever be at rest.

With ten thousand angels round Him,

Hallelujah! O praise ye the Lord!

Hear them shouting thro’ the air.

Now His glory they shall share.

Immortal Love, Forever Full
</title>
<lyric>
1
Immortal Love, forever full,
Forever flowing free,
Forever shared, forever whole,
A never ebbing sea!

2
We nay not climb the heavenly steeps
To bring the Lord Christ down;
In vain we search the lowest deeps,
For him no depths can drown.

3
But warm, so tender, even yet
A present help is He;
And faith has still its Olivet,
And love its Galilee.

4
The healing of His seamless dress
Is by our beds of pain;
We touch Him in life’s throng and press,
And we are whole again.
5
Through Him the first fond prayers are said,
Our lips of childhood frame;
The last low whispers of our dead
Are burdened with His name.

6
O Lord and Master of us all:
Whate’er our names or sign,
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,
We test our lives by Thine!

I have a Friend so precious,
So very dear to me,
He loves me with such tender love,
He loves so faithfully;
I could not live apart form Him,
I love to feel Him nigh,
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.

2
Sometimes I’m faint and weary,
He knows that I am weak,
And as He bids me lean on Him,
His help I gladly seek;
He leads me in the paths of light,
Beneath a sunny sky,
And so we walk together,
My Lord and I.

3
I tell Him all my sorrows,
I tell Him all my joys,
I tell Him all that pleases me,
I tell Him what annoys;
He tells me what I ought to do,
He tells me how to try,
And so we talk together,
My Lord and I.

4
He knows that I am longing
Some weary soul to win,
And so He bids me go and speak
The loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love,
And why He came to die,
And so we work together,
My Lord and I.

I Love to Tell the Story
</title>
<lyric>
1
I love to tell the story
of unseen things above,
of Jesus and his glory,
of Jesus and his love.
I love to tell the story,
because I know ’tis true;
it satisfies my longings
as nothing else can do.

Refrain:
I love to tell the story,
’twill be my theme in glory,
to tell the old, old story
of Jesus and his love.

2
I love to tell the story;
more wonderful it seems
than all the golden fancies
of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story,
it did so much for me;
and that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee.

3
I love to tell the story;
’tis pleasant to repeat
what seems, each time I tell it,
more wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story,
for some have never heard
the message of salvation
from God’s own holy Word.

4
I love to tell the story,
for those who know it best
seem hungering and thirsting
to hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
I sing the new, new song,
’twill be the old, old story
that I have loved so long.

More love to thee, O Christ, more love to thee!
Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.
This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to thee;
more love to thee, more love to thee!

Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;
now thee alone I seek, give what is best.
This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;
more love to thee, more love to thee!

Let sorrow do its work, come grief and pain;
sweet are thy messengers, sweet their Refrain:,
when they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to thee;
more love to thee, more love to thee!

this be the parting cry my heart shall raise;
this still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;

To mansions in the skies

And wipe my weeping eyes;

And wipe my weeping eyes.

Should earth against my soul engage,
And fiery darts be hurled,
Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,
And face a frowning world;

And face a frowning world.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“Come unto Me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast.”
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary and worn and sad;
I found in Him a resting place,
And He has made me glad.

2
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“Behold, I freely give
The living water; thirsty one,
Stoop down and drink and live.”
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life giving stream;
My thirst was quench’d, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.

3
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“I am this dark world’s light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright.”
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my star, my sun;
And in that light of life I’ll walk,
Till trav’ling days are done.

Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight,
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
In celestial like strains it unceasingly falls
O’er my soul like an infinite calm.

Refrain:
Peace! Peace! wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,
In fathomless billows of love.

2
What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in my inner most soul,
So secure that no power can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll!

3
I believe when I rise to that city of peace,
Where the Author of peace I shall see,
That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom will be-
4
Weary soul, without gladness or comfort or rest,
Passing down the rough pathway of time!
Make the Savior your friend ere the shadows grow dark;
O accept of this peace so sublime.

Life Is Great! So Sing About It
</title>
<lyric>
1
Life is great! So sing about it,
As we can and as we should-
Shop and buses, towns and people,
Village, farmland, field and wood,
Life is great and life is given;
Life is lovely, free and good.

2
Life is great! What ever happens,
Snow or sunshine, joy or pain,
Hardship, grief or disillusion,
Suffering that I can’t explain
Life is great if someone loves me,
Holds my hand and calls my name.

3
Love is great! The love of lovers,
Whispered words and longing eyes;
Love that gazes at the cradle
Where a child of loving lies;
Love that lasts when youth has faded,
Bends with age, but never dies.
4
Love is giving and receiving
Boy and girl, or friend with friend;
Love is bearing and forgiving
All the hurts that hate can send;
Love’s the greatest way of living,
Hoping, trusting to the end.

5
God is great! in Christ He loved us,
As we should, but never can-
Love that suffered, hoped and trusted
When disciples turned and ran,
Love that broke through death forever.
Praise that loving, living Man!

A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,

2
My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is pleading our pardon on high,
That we may be His when He comes by and by.

3
I once was an outcast stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, an alien by birth,
But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.
4
A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
They’re building a palace for me over there;
Though exiled from home, yet still may I sing:
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King.

A Song of Heaven and Homeland

1
Sometimes I hear strange music,
Like none e’er heard before,
Come floating softly earthward
As thro’ heav’n's open door:
It seems like angel voices,
In strains of and love,
That swell the mighty chorus
Around the throne above.

Refrain:
O sweet, celestial music,
Heard from a land afar-
The song of Heav’n and Homeland,
Thro’ doors God leaves ajar!

2
Now soft, and low, and restful,
It floods my soul with peace,
As if God’s benediction
Bade all earth’s troubles cease.
Then grander than the voices,
Of wind, and wave, and sea-
It fills the dome of heaven
With glorious harmony.

3
This music haunts me ever,
Like something heard in dreams-
It seems to catch the cadence
Of heav’nly winds and streams,
My heart is filled with rapture,
To think, some day to come,
I’ll sing it with the angels-
The song of heav’n and home.

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
that calls me from a world of care,

In seasons of distress and grief,

and oft escaped the tempter’s snare
by thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
thy wings shall my petition bear

May I thy consolation share
Till from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height

“Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!”

reclothe us in our rightful mind,
in purer lives thy service find,
in deeper reverence, praise.

2
In simple trust like theirs who heard,
beside the Syrian sea,
the gracious calling of the Lord,
let us, like them, without a word,
rise up and follow thee.

3
O sabbath rest by Galilee,
O calm of hills above,
where Jesus knelt to share with thee
the silence of eternity,
interpreted by love!



4
Drop thy still dews of quietness,
till all our strivings cease;
take from our souls the strain and stress,
and let our ordered lives confess
the beauty of thy peace.

5
Breathe through the heats of our desire
thy coolness and thy balm;
let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,
O still, small voice of calm.

Father, Lead Me Day by Day

1
Father, lead me day by day,
Ever in Thine own sweet way;
Teach me to be pure and true;
Show me what I ought to do.

When in danger, make me brave;
Make me know that Thou canst save;
Keep me safe by Thy dear side;
Let me in Thy love abide.

When tempted to do wrong,
Make me steadfast, wise, and strong;
And when all alone I stand,
Shield me with Thy mighty hand.

May I do the good I know,
Be Thy loving child below,
Then at last go home to Thee,
Evermore Thy child to be.

I Need Thee, Precious Jesus

1
I need Thee precious Jesus, for I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store.
I need the love of Jesus to cheer me on my way,
To guide my doubting foot steps, to be my strength and stay.

2
I need the heart of Jesus to feel each anxious care,
To tell my every trial, and all my sorrows share.
I need the Holy Spirit to teach me what I am,
To show me more of Jesus, to point me to the Lamb.

3
I need Thee precious Jesus, I hope to see Thee soon,
Encircled with the rainbow, and seated on Thy throne.
There with Thy blood-bought children, my joy shall ever be
To sing Thy ceaseless praises, to gaze, my Lord, on Thee.

Till Thou Thy Spirit give.

Could I but see Thy face!

And taste Thy pardoning grace.

That Jesus died for me,
And that He shed His precious blood
From sin to set me free.

In the Garden

While the dew is still on the roses;
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,
The Son of God discloses.

And He walks with me,
And He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.

He speaks, and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing.

Though the night around me be falling,
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe,
His voice to me is calling.

To everlasting day!

And next I prayed for strength:
That I might tread the road
With firm, unfaltering feet, and win
The heaven’s serene abode.

3
And then I asked for faith:
Could I but trust my God,
I’d live infolded in His peace,
Though foes were all abroad.

But now I pray for love:
Deep love to God and man;
A living love that will not fail,
However dark His plan.
5
And light and strength and faith
Are opening everywhere!
God waited patiently until
I prayed the larger prayer.

In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
When Thou see’st me waver, with a look recall,
Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.

With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm;
Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;
Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,
Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.

Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see;

For things that could not satisfy:

Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more–

The pleasures earthly things afford;

Across the little landscape of our life;
We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen
For the last conflict, in this mortal strife.

Where on our feet were set with sovereign grace;
Not life, nor death, with all their agitation,
Can thence remove us, gazing on His face.

Which for long years we did rejoice to see;
The blessings of this sinful world are failing;
We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.

Strength, joy and willingness come with the sight;
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,
Soon to return and end this mortal night!

O gracious Father of mankind,
Our spirits’ unseen friend;
High heaven’s Lord, our hearts’ dear guest,
To Thee our prayers ascend.

Thou dost not wait till human speech
Thy gifts divine implore;
Our dreams, our aims, our work, our lives
Are prayers Thou lovest more.

3
Thou hearest these, the good and ill,
Deep buried in each breast;
The secret thought, the hidden plan,
Wrought out our unexpressed.

4
O cleanse our prayers from human dross,
Attune our lives to Thee,
Until we labor for those gifts
We ask on bended knee.
5
Our best is but Thyself in us,
Our highest thought Thy will;
To hear Thy voice we need but love,
And listen, and be still.

6
We would not bend Thy will to ours,
But blend our wills to Thine;
Not dreams, our aims, our work, our lives
Are prayers Thou lovest more.

Thou seekest us in love and truth
More than our minds seek Thee;
Through open gates Thy power flows in
Like flood tides from the sea.

Nor ask Thee for a sign,
Content to pray in life and love
And toil, till all are Thine.

The solemn hush of nature newly born;
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.

A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,
So does this blessed consciousness, awaking,
Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.

When the soul waketh and life’s shadows flee;

All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
Oh, what peace we often forfeit;

All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do your friends despise, forsake you?
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
In his arms he’ll take and shield you;
You will find a solace there.

By looking to Jesus,

beneath his control.

A Mighty Fortress

<lyric>
1
A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing;
our helper he amid the flood
of mortal ills prevaling.
For still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.

2
Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right man on our side,
the man of God’s own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is he;
Lord Sabbaoth, his name,
from age to age the same,
and he must win the battle.


3
And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God hath willed
his truth to triumph through us.
The Prince of Darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
for lo, his doom is sure;
one little word shall fell him.

4
That word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, abideth;
the Spirit and the gifts are ours,
thru him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill;
God’s truth abideth still;
his kingdom is forever.

Just when I need Him most.
Just when I need Him most,
Just when I need Him most,
Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,
Just when I need Him most.

4
Just when I need Him, He is my all,
Answering when upon Him I call;
Tenderly watching lest I should fall,
Just when I need Him most.
Just when I need Him most,
Just when I need Him most,
Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,
Just when I need Him most.

In Heavenly Love Abiding
</title>
<lyric>
1
In heavenly love abiding, No change my heart shall fear;
And safe is such confiding, For nothing changes here.
The storm may roar without me, My heart may low be laid;
But God is round about me, And can I be dismayed?

2
Wherever He may guide me, No want shall turn me back;
My Shepherd is besided me, And nothing can I lack.
His wisdom ever waketh, His sight is never dim;
He knows the way He taketh, And I will walk with Him.

3
Green pastures are before me, Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be o’er me, Where darkest clouds have been.
My hope I cannot measure, My path to life is free;
My Savior has my teasure, And He will walk with me.

Lord of Our Life

1
Lord of our life, and God of our salvation,
Star of our night, and hope of every nation,
Hear and receive Thy church’s supplication,
Lord God Almighty.

2
Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth;
Lord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth;
Lord, o’er Thy rock nor death nor hell prevaileth;
Grant us Thy peace, Lord

3
Peace in our hearts our evil thoughts assuaging;
Peace in Thy church, where brothers are engaging;
Peace, when the world its busy war is waging;
Send us, O Savior.

4
Grant us Thy help till foes are backward driven;
Grant them Thy truth that they may be forgiven;
Grant peace on earth, and, after we have striven,
Peace in Thy heaven.

The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?
By day and by night His presence is near;
He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;
This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.

Refrain:
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along;
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along.

The Lord is my light; though clods may arise,
Faith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:
Then how can I ever in darkness remain?

3
The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength;
I know in His might I’ll conquer at length;
My weakness in mercy He covers with power,
And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.
4
The lord is my light, my all and in all;
There is in His sight no darkness at all;
He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;
With saints and with angels His praises I sing.

What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who through life has been my guide?
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell;
For I know whate’er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well;
For I know whate’er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well.

All the way my Savior leads me;
Cheers each winding path I tread;
Gives me grace for every trial,
Feeds me with the living bread;
Though my weary steps may falter,
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo, a spring of joy I see;
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo, a spring of joy I see.
3
All the way my Savior leads me;
O the fullness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father’s house above;
When I wake to life immortal,
Wing my flight to realms of day,
This my song through endless ages,
Jesus led me all the way;

Depth of mercy!–can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear?

Long provoked Him to His face,
Would not hearken to His calls,
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.

Let me now my sins lament;
Now my foul revolt deplore,
Weep, believe, and sin no more.

Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;

Jesus weeps, and loves me still.

In times when temptation casts over me its power;
In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,

This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

From every stormy wind that blows, From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat: ‘Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

There is a place where Jesus sheds The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all besides more sweet; It is the blood-bought mercy seat.

3
There is a scene where spirits blend, Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet Around one common mercy seat.

4
There, there, on angel’s wings we soar, And earthly cares molest no more,
And heaven comes down our souls to greet, And glory crowns the mercy seat.

Ah! whither should we flee for aid, When tempted, desolate dismayed?
Or how the hosts of sin defeat, Had suffering saints no mercy seat?

Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;

Strength I find, to meet my trials here;
Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment,

He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure
Gives unto each day what He deems best—
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.

2
Every day, the Lord Himself is near me
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
He Whose Name is Counselor and Power;
The protection of His child and treasure
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
“As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,”
This the pledge to me He made.

3
Help me then in every tribulation
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
Ever to take, as from a father’s hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till I reach the promised land.

Beneath the chastening rod,
But in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain
Can lean upon its God; Can lean upon its God.

A faith that shines more bright and clear
When tempests rage without;
That when in danger knows no fear, knows of no fear,
In darkness feels no doubt; In darkness feels no doubt.

4
That bears unmoved the world’s dread frown,
Nor heeds its scornful smile;
That sin’s wild ocean cannot drown, no, cannot drown,
Nor its soft arts beguile; Nor its soft arts beguile.
5

And then, whate’er may come
I’ll taste, e’en here the hallowed bliss, the hallowed bliss
Of an eternal home; Of an eternal home.

When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,
Will your anchor drift or firm remain?

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the Savior’s love.

For ’tis well secured by the Savior’s hand;
And the cables passed from His heart to mine,
Can defy the blast, through strength divine.

3
It will firmly hold in the straits of fear,
When the breakers have told the reef is near;
Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,
Not an angry wave shall our bark o’erflow.
4
It will surely hold in the floods of death,
When the waters cold chill our latest breath;
On the rising tide it can never fail,
While our hopes abide within the veil.

Shining gates of pearl, our harbor bright,
We shall anchor fast to the heavenly shore,
With the storms all past forevermore.

Since the childhood of our race;
Knowing the ecstasy of winging
Through untraveled realms of space,

Facing us with life’s destruction
Or our most triumphant hour.

Thou hast bought us, thine we are.

2
We are thine, thou dost befriend us,
be the guardian of our way;
keep thy flock, from sin defend us,
seek us when we go astray.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
Hear, O hear us when we pray.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
Hear, O hear us when we pray.

3
Thou hast promised to receive us,
poor and sinful though we be;
thou hast mercy to relieve us,
grace to cleanse and power to free.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
We will early turn to thee.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
We will early turn to thee.

The Lord's My Shepherd

<lyric>
1
The Lord’s my shepherd, I’ll not want
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; he leadeth me
The quiet waters by.
He leadeth me, He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

2
My soul he doth restore again
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness
Even for his own name’s sake.
Within the paths of righteousness
Even for his own name’s sake.

3
Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale
Yet will I fear no ill
For thou art with me, and thy rod
And staff me comfort still.
For thou art with me, and thy rod
And staff me comfort still.
4
My table thou has furnished
In presence of my foes;
My head thou dost with oil anoint
And my cup overflows.
My head thou dost with oil anoint
And my cup overflows.

5
Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me,
And in God’s house for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.
And in God’s house for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.

Now Praise the Hidden God of Love
</title>
<lyric>
1
Now praise the hidden God of love
In whom we all must live and move,
Who shepherds us, at every stage
Thro’ youth, maturity, and age.

2
Who challenged us, when were young
To storm the citadels of wrong;
In care for others taught us how
God’s true community must grow.

3
Who bids us never lose our zest,
Tho’ age is urging us to rest,
But proves to us that we have still
A work to do, a place to fill.

4
Then talk no more of wasted time,
But Godward look, and upward climb,
Content to sleep, when day is done,
And rise refreshed, and travel on.

Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep,
Keep Thy lamb, in safety keep;

Teach Thy lamb Thy voice to hear;

From the straight and narrow way.

Walking in Thy steps below,

As saints of old their first fruits brought
Of orchard, flock, and field
To God the giver all good,
The source of bounteous yield;
So we today first fruits would bring:
The wealth of this good land,
Of farm and market, shop and home,
Of mind, and heart, and hand.

2
A world in need now summons us
To labor, love, and give;
To make our life an offering
To God, that all may live.
The Church of Christ is calling us
To make the dream come true:
A world redeemed by Christ-like love;
All life in Christ made new.

3
In gratitude and humble trust
We bring our best today,
To serve Your cause and share Your love
With all along life’s way.
O God, who gave yourself to us
In Jesus Christ Your Son,
Teach us to give ourselves each day
Until life’s work is done.

Raise the song of harvest home;

Ere the winter storms begin.

For our wants to be supplied;
Come to God’s own temple, come;
Raise the song of harvest home!

We ourselves are God’s own field,
Fruit unto His praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown,
Unto joy or sorrow grown;
First the blade and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear;
Grant, O harvest Lord, that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.

3
For the Lord our God shall come,
And shall take His harvest home;
From His field shall purge away
All that doth offend, that day;
Give His angels charge at last
In the fire the tares to cast;
But the fruitful ears to store
In His garner evermore.

4
Then, thou church triumphant, come,
Raise the song of harvest home;
All are safely gathered in,
Free from sorrow, free from sin,
There, forever purified,
In God’s garner to abide;
Come, ten thousand angels, come,

Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving
To God the Creator triumphantly raise,
Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us,
Who guideth us on to the end of our days.

His light goes before us,
A pillar of fire shining forth in the night,
‘Til shadows have vanished and darkness is banished,
as forward we travel from light into light.

His law He enforces: the stars in their courses,
The sun in His orbit, obediently shine;
The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,
The deeps of the ocean proclaim Him divine,
We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,
With glad adoration a song let us raise,
‘Til all things now living unite in thanksgiving
To God in the highest, hosanna and praise.

We plow the fields, and scatter the good seed on the land,
But it is fed and watered by God’s almighty hand.
He sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain,
The breezes and the sunshine, and soft refreshing rain.

Refrain:
All good gifts around us
Are sent from heaven above;
Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord
For all His love.

He paints the wayside flower, He lights the evening star.
The winds and waves obey Him, by Him the birds are fed;
Much more, to us His children, He gives our daily bread.

We thank Thee then, O Father, for all things bright and good,
The seed-time and the harvest, our life, our health, and food.

Shall we, sometimes forgetful oh where creation starts,
With science in our pockets lose wonder from our hearts?

Accept these gifts we offer, our service and our songs.

Make each of us more ready to share our daily bread.

Or over the stormy sea,

Which Jesus would have me speak
There may be now in the paths of sin

Tho dark and rugged the way,

There’s surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth’s harvest fields so wide
Where I may labor through life’s short day

O’er hosts of hell, o’er darkness, death, and sin,
May name to bear, and in that name to conquer-
So send I you, My victory to win.

2
So send I you- to take to souls in bondage
The word of truth that sets the captive fee,
To break the bonds of sin, to loose dearth’s fetters-
So send I you, to bring the lost to Me.

3
So send I you- My strength to know in weakness,
My joy in grief, my perfect peace in pain,
To prove My power, My grace, My promised presence-
So send I you, eternal fruit to gain.

'Tis Love That Makes Us Happy
</title>
<lyric>
1
‘Tis love that makes us happy,
‘Tis love that smooths the way;
It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.

Refrain:
God is love; we’re his little children.
God is love; we would be like Him.
‘Tis love that makes us happy,
‘Tis love that smooths the way;
It helps us “mind,” it makes us kind
To others every day.

2
This world is full of sorrow,
Of sickness, death, and sin;
With loving heart we’ll do our part,
And try some soul to win.

3
And when this life is over,
And we are called above
Our song shall be, eternally,
Of Jesus and His love.

When the Church of Jesus
</title>
<lyric>
1
When the church of Jesus shuts its outer door,
Lest the roar of traffic drown the voice of prayer:
May our prayers, Lord make up ten times more aware
That the world we banish is our Christian care.

2
If our hearts are lifted where devotion soars
High above this hungry suffering world of ours:
Lest our hymns should drug us to forget its needs,
Forge our Christian worship into Christian deeds.

3
Lest the gifts we offer, money, talents, time,
Serve to salve our conscience to our secret shame:
Lord, reprove, inspire us by the way you give;
Teach us, dying Savior, how true Christians live.

Working, O Christ, With Thee

<lyric>
1
Working, O Christ, with Thee, working with Thee,
Unworthy, sinful, weak, though we may be;
Our all to Thee we give, for Thee alone we live,
And by Thy grace achieve, working with Thee.

2
Along the city’s waste, working with Thee,
Our eager footsteps haste, like Thee to be;
The poor we gather in, the outcasts raise from sin,
And labor souls to win, working with Thee.

3
Savior, we weary not, working with Thee,
As hard as Thine our lot can never be;
Our joy and comfort this, “Thy grace sufficent is;”
This changes toil to bliss, working with Thee.

4
So let us labor on, working with Thee,
Till earth to Thee is won, from sin set free;
Till men, from shore to shore, receive Thee, and adore,
And join us evermore, working with Thee.

You that know the Lord is gracious,
You for whom a cornerstone
Stands, of God elect and precious,
Laid that you may build there-on,
See that on that sure foundation
You a living temple raise.
Towers that may tell forth salvation,
Walls that may reech-o praise.

2
Living stones by God appointed
Each to his allotted place,
Kings and priests, by God anointed,
Shall you not declare His grace?
You, a royal generation,
Tell the tidings of your birth,
Tidings of a new creation
To an old and weary earth.

3
Tell the praise of Him who called you
Out of darkness into light,
Broke the fetters that enthralled you,
Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:
Tell the tale of sins forgiven,
Strength renewed and hope restored,
Till the earth, in tune with heaven,
Praise and magnify the Lord.

When Christ Was Lifted From the Earth
</title>
<lyric>
1
When Christ was lifted from the earth His arms stretched out above
Through every culture, every birth, to draw an answering love.

2
Still east and west His love extends and always, near or far,
He calls and claims us as His friends and loves us as we are.

3
Where generation, class, or race divides us to our shame,
He sees not labels but a face, a person and a name.

4
Thus freely loved, tho’ fully known, may I in Christ be free
To welcome and accept His own as Christ accepted me.

To love all people, every race,

Break down the wall that would divide

Help me forgive, remembering Thee.

Hear and grant our heart’s request
For that gift supreme and best:
Holy heav’nly love.

Faith that mountains could remove,
Tongues of earth or heaven above,
Knowledge, all things, empty prove
If I have no love.

Though I as a martyr bleed,
Give my goods the poor to feed,
All is vain if love I need:
Therefore give me love.

Love is pure and thinks no wrong,
Love than death it self more strong:
Therefore give us love.

Prophecy will fade away,
Melting in the light of day;

Therefore give us love.

Joining hand in hand agree-
But the greatest of the three,
And the best is love.

Trust and Obey
</title>
<lyric>
1
When we walk with the Lord
in the light of his word,
what a glory he sheds on our way!
While we do his good will,
he abides with us still,
and with all who will trust and obey.

Refrain:
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.

2
Not a shadow can rise,
not a cloud in the skies,
but his smile quickly drives it away;
not a doubt nor a fear,
not a sigh nor a tear,
can abide while we trust and obey.

3
Not a burden we bear,
not a sorrow we share,
but our toil he doth richly repay;
not a grief or a loss,
not a frown or a cross,
but is blest if we trust and obey.

4
But we never can prove
the delights of his love
until all on the altar we lay;
for the favor he shows,
and the joy he bestows,
are for them who will trust and obey.

5
Then in fellowship sweet
we will sit at his feet,
or we’ll walk by his side in the way;
what he says we will do,
where he sends we will go;
never fear, only trust and obey.

Watch for the glory of earth’s coming King;
Lo! o’er the mountaintops light is now breaking;

Then Medo-Persia’s banners were unfurled;
And after Greece held universal sway,

Weak and divided, soon to pass away;
What will the next great, glorious drama be?

Once to Every Man and Nation

1
Once to every man and nation, comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side;
Some great cause, some great decision, offering each the bloom or blight,
And the choice goes by forever, ’twixt that darkness and that light.

2
Then to side with truth is noble, when we share her wretched crust,
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and ’tis prosperous to be just;
Then it is the brave man chooses while the coward stands aside,
Till the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied.

3
By the light of burning martyrs, Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,
Toiling up new Calv’ries ever with the cross that turns not back;
New occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth,
They must upward still and onward, who would keep abreast of truth.

4
Though the cause of evil prosper, yet the truth alone is strong;
Though her portion be the scaffold, and upon the throne be wrong;
Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown,
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own.

White raiment shall be giv’n;
Before the angels he shall know
His name confessed in heav’n.
Then onward from the hills of light,
Our hearts with love aflame;
We’ll vanquish all the hosts of night,
In Jesus’ conq’ring name.

Am I a Soldier of the Cross?
</title>
<lyric>
1
Am I a soldier of the cross,
a follower of the Lamb,
and shall I fear to own his cause,
or blush to speak his name?

2
Must I be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease,
while others fought to win the prize,
and sailed through bloody seas?

3
Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
to help me on to God?

4
Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
increase my courage, Lord
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,
supported by thy word
5
Thy saints in all this glorious war
shall conquer though they die;
they see the triumph from afar,
by faith they bring it nigh

6
When that illustrious day shall rise,
and all thy armies shine
in robes of victory through the skies,
the glory shall be thine

Stand Like the Brave

O Christian, awake! ’tis the Master’s command;
With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,
To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

Refrain:
Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,
Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

2
The cause of thy Master with vigor defend;
Be watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end;
Wherever He leads thee, go, valiantly go,
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

3
Press on, never doubting, thy Captain is near,
With grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer;
His love, like a stream in the desert will flow;
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

Gates of hell can never ‘gainst that church prevail;

We are living, we are dwelling, In a grand and awful time,
In an age on ages telling– To be living is sublime.
Hark! the waking up of nations, Gog and Magog to the fray;
Hark! what soundeth? Is creation Groaning for her latter day?

Christian, rouse and arm for conflict, Nerve thee for the battlefield;
Bear the helmet of salvation, And the mighty gospel shield;
Let the breastplate, peace, be on thee, Take the Spirit’s sword in hand;
Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then, In Jehovah’s strength to stand.

3
And the prince of evil spirits, Great deceiver of the world!
He who at the blessed Jesus Once his deadly weapons hurled,
Cometh with unwonted power, Knowing that his reign will cease
When the kingdom shall be given To the mighty Prince of Peace.

Christians, rouse! fight in this warfare, Cease not till the victory’s won;
Till your Captain loud proclaimeth, “Servant of the Lord, well done!”

On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.
I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
O who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

2
O’er all those wide extended plain
Shines one eternal day;
There, Christ, the Sun, for ever reigns,
And scatters night away.
I am bound for the promised land,

I am bound for the promised land;
O who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

3
When shall I reach that happy place,
And be forever blest?
When shall I see my Father’s face,
And in His kingdom rest?
I am bound for the promised land,

I am bound for the promised land;
O who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

4
Filled with delight, my raptured soul
Would here no longer stay;
Though Jordan’s waves around me roll,
Fearless I’d launch away.
I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
O who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

From the foe’s destructive power;
Save, O save them, Lord, from falling
In this dark and trying hour.
Thou wilt surely prove Thy people,
All our graces must be tried;
But Thy word illumes our pathway,
And in God we still confide.

We are in the time of waiting;
Soon we shall behold our Lord,
Wafted far away from sorrow,
To receive our rich reward.
Keep us, Lord, till Thine appearing,
Pure, unspotted from the world;
Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us
Till Thy banner is unfurled.

With what joyful exultation
Shall the saints Thy banner see,
When the Lord for whom we’ve waited
Shall proclaim the jubilee!
Freedom from this world’s pollutions;
Freedom from all sin and pain;
Freedom from the wiles of Satan,
And from death’s destructive reign.

For faith has caught the joyful sound,

And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.

For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:
And remember each step that by faith we passo’er,
Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.

We shall hear the glad words, “Come up hither, ye blest,
Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.”

Paths and sign posts lost in doubt,

Keep us through the aching night
Till new dawns awaken.

Painfully accuse us,
Stab our conscience, steal our worth,

Daily resurrection,
Strong companion at our side

Open door to life and peace,
Window into glory.

Made His close relation:

And these be the treasures
We offer to the King,
And these are gifts that ever
The poorest child may bring.

3
We’ll bring the little duties
We have to do each day;
We’ll try our best to please Him
At home, at school, at play:
And better are these treasures
To offer to the King
Than richest gift without them:
Yet these a child may bring.

A Diligent and Grateful Heart

1
A diligent and grateful heart
Prompts me to sing Thy praise.
Thy love and mercies from the start
Have blessed me all my days.

2
I thank Thee for the means to serve
With talents and with tithes,
For sharing brings the utmost joy
When lifting other lives.

3

My thanks I give you for stewardship
To minister through deeds,
To serve and share with patient care
Thy people in their needs.

4
O Lord, I dedicate my all
In this response to Thee.
Help me to magnify this call
In deep humility.

For Beauty of Meadows
</title>
<lyric>
1
For beauty of meadows, for grandeur of trees,
For flowers of woodlands, for creatures of seas,
For all You created and gave us to share,
We praise You,
Creator, extolling your care.

2
As stewards of beauty received at Your hand,
As creatures who hear Your most urgent command,
We turn from our wasteful destruction of life,
Confessing our failures, confessing our strife.

3
Teach us once again to be gardeners in peace;
All nature around us is ours but on lease;

Your name we would hallow in all that we do,
Fulfilling our calling, creating with You.

God in His Love for Us
</title>
<lyric>
1
God in His love for us lent us this planet,
Gave it a purpose in time and in space:
Small as a spark from the fire of creation,
Cradle of life and the home of our race.

2
Thanks be to God for its bounty and beauty,
Life that sustains us in body and mind:
Plenty for all, if we learn how to share it,
Riches undreamed of to fathom and find.

3
Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;
Long has earth bowed to the terror of forced;
Long have we wasted what others have need of,
Poisoned the fountain of life at its source.

4
Earth is the Lord’s: it is ours to enjoy it,
Ours, as His stewards, to farm and defend.
From its pollution, misuse, and destruction,
Good Lord, deliver us, world without end!

O Lord
Kept sharp think Thy thought;
Come,
Holy Ghost with grace outpoured,
To teach what Christ hath taught.

In all our learning may we seek
That wisdom from above
Which comes to all: the brave,
the meek
Who ask in faith and love.

2
We praise Thee thro’ our bodies,
Lord,
Kept strong to do Thy will;

Thy Spirit’s temples, which afford
A means to praise Thee still.
We give ourselves, a sacrifice,
To live as unto Thee;
For Thou alone hast paid the price
To bring salvation free.


3
We praise Thee in our hearts,
O king,
Kept pure to know Thy ways;
And raise to Thee a hymn to sing

Eternally Thy praise.
Altho adoring hearts will bow

As age on ages roll;
We praise Thee in our beings now,
Mind, body, heart, and soul.

Of all things in Christ the head.

Rules in endless majesty;
May the kings of every nation
Now foreswear their enmity,
And with humble veneration
In the love of God agree.

And on justice let them feed.

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;

His truth is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free!

I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,
Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love:
The love that asks the reason, the love that stands the test,
That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.

2
And there’s another country, I’ve heard of long ago,
Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;
We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;
And one by one and fervently we pray for her increase,
And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.
