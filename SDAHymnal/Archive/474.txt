Take the Name of Jesus With You

1
Take the Name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe,
It will joy and comfort give you;
Take it then, where弾r you go.

Refrain:
Precious Name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of Heav地.
Precious Name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of Heav地.

2
Take the Name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy Name in prayer.

3
O the precious Name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ!
4
At the Name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heav地 we値l crown Him,
When our journey is complete.
