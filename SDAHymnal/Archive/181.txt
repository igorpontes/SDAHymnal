181  Does Jesus Care?


1

Does Jesus care when my heart is pained Too deeply for mirth and song;

As the burdens press, and the cares distress, And the way grows weary and long?


Refrain

O yes, He cares- I know He cares! His heart is touched with my grief; When the days are weary,

The long nights dreary,

I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)


2

Does Jesus care when my way is dark With a nameless dread and fear?

As the daylight fades into deep night shades, Does He care enough to be near?


3

Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye To the dearest on earth to me,

And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks - Is it aught to Him? Does He see?
