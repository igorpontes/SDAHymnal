132  O Come, All Ye Faithful


1

O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem! Come and behold Him,

born the King of angels! O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!


2

Sing, choirs of angels sing in exultation,

O sing all ye citizens of heaven above! Glory to God, all glory in the highest!

O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!


3

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning,
Jesus, to Thee be all glory given; Word of the Father,

now in flesh appearing! O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!
