138  Rise Up, Shepherd, and Follow


1

There's a star in the east on Christmas morn. Rise up shepherd, and follow.

It will lead to the place where the Savior's born, Rise up shepherd, and follow.


Refrain

Leave your sheep and leave your lambs, Rise up, shepherd, and follow.

Leave your ewes and leave your rams, Rise up shepherd, and follow.
Follow, follow, Rise up, shepherd and follow.

Follow the star of Behlehem, Rise up, shepherd, and follow.


2

If you take good heed to the angel's words, Rise up, shepherd, and follow.

You'll forget your flocks, you'll forget your herds, Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
