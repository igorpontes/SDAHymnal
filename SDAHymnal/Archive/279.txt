Only Trust Him

1
Come, every soul by sin oppressed,
There’s mercy with the Lord,
And He will surely give you rest,
By trusting in His word.

Refrain:
Only trust Him, only trust Him,
Only trust Him now;
He will save you, He will save you,
He will save you now.

2
For Jesus shed his precious blood
Rich blessings to bestow;
Plunge now into the crimson flood
That washes white as snow.

3
Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way,
That leads you into rest;
Believe in Him without delay,
And you are fully blest.
4
Come, then, and join this holy band,
And on to glory go,
To dwell in that celestial land,
Where joys immortal flow.
