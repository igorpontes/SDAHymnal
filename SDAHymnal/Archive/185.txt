185  Jesus Is All the World to Me


1

Jesus is all the world to me, my life, my joy, my all;

he is my strength from day to day, without him I would fall.

When I am sad, to him I go, no other one can cheer me so;

when I am sad, he makes me glad, he's my friend.


2

Jesus is all the world to me, my friend in trials sore;

I go to him for blessings, and he gives them o'er and o'er.

He sends the sunshine and the rain, he sends the harvest's golden grain; sunshine and rain, harvest of grain, he's my friend.


3

Jesus is all the world to me, and true to him I'll be;

O how could I this friend deny, when he's so true to me? Following him I know I'm right, he watches o'er me day and night;
following him by day and night, he's my friend.


4

Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend;

I trust him now, I'll trust him when life's fleeting days shall end. Beautiful life with such a friend, beautiful life that has no end; eternal life, eternal joy,
he's my friend.
