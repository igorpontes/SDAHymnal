27  Rejoice, Ye Pure in Heart!


1

Rejoice ye pure in heart! Rejoice, give thanks, and sing; Your festal banner wave on high, The cross of Christ your King.


Refrain

Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice,
Give thanks and sing.


2

With voice as full and strong As ocean's surging praise,

Send forth the sturdy hymns of old, The psalms of ancient days.


3

With all the angel choirs, With all the saints of earth,

Pour out the strains of joy and bliss, True rapture, noblest mirth.


4

Yes, on through life's long path, Still chanting as ye go;

From youth to age, by night and day, In gladness and in woe.
5

Praise Him who reigns on high, The Lord whom we adore,

The Father, Son and Holy Ghost, One God forever more. (Refrain)
