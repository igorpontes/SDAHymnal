128  Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light


1

Break forth, O beautiful heavenly light, And usher in the morning;

Ye shepherds, shrink not with affright, But hear the abgel's warning.

This child, now weak in infancy, Our confidence and joy shall be, The power of Satan breaking, Our peace eternal making.


2

Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light To herald our salvation;

He stoops to earth-the God of might, Our hope and expectation.

He comes in human flesh to dwell, Our God with us, Immanuel,

The night of darkness ending, Our fallen race befriending.
