12  Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee


1

Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee, God of glory, Lord of love;

Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee, Hail Thee as the sun above.

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness, Drive the dark of doubt away; Giver of immortal gladness,

Fill us with the light of day!


2

All Thy works with joy surround Thee, Earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays, Stars and angels sing around Thee, Center of unbroken praise;

Field and forest, vale and mountain, Bloss'ming meadow, flashing sea, Chanting bird and flowing fountain Call us to rejoice in Thee.


3

Thou art giving and forgiving, Ever blessing, ever blest, Wellspring of the joy of living, Oceandepth of happy rest!

Thou the father, Christ our Brother - All who live in love are Thine:
Teach us how to love each other, Lift us to the joy divine.
