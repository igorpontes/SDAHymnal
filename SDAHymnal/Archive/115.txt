115  O Come, O Come, Immanuel


1

O come, O come, Immanuel, And ransom captive Israel That mourns in lonely exile here Until the Son of God appear.


Refrain

Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel!


2

O come, Thou Wisdom from on high, And order all things, far and nigh; To us the path of knowledge show, And cause us in her ways to go.


3

O come, Desire of nations, bind All peoples in one heart and mind; Bid envy, strife, and quarrels cease;

Fill the whole world with heaven's peace.
