I Know Whom I Have Believed

1
I know not why God’s wondrous grace To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love Redeemed me for His own.

Refrain:
But “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that His is able
To keep that which I’ve committed Unto Him against that day.”

2
I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His word Wrought peace within my heart.

3
I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the word, Creating faith in Him.

4
I know not when my Lord may come, At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I walk the vale with Him, Or meet Him in the air.
