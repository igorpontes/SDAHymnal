182  Christ Is Alive


1

Christ is alive! Let Christians sing.
His cross stands empty to the sky.

Let streets and homes with praises ring. His love in death shall never die.


2

Christ is alive! No longer bound

To distant years in Palestine,

He comes to claim the here and now And conquer every place and time.


3

In every insult, rift, and war

Where color, scorn or wealth divide, He suffers still, yet loves the more, And lives, though ever crucified.


4

Christ is alive! Ascended Lord

He rules the world His Father made, Till, in the end, His love adored Shall be to all on earth displayed.
