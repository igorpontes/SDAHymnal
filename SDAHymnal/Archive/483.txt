I Need Thee Every Hour

1
I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord;
no tender voice like thine can peace afford.

Refrain:
I need thee, O I need thee;
every hour I need thee;
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to thee.

2
I need thee every hour; stay thou nearby;
temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.

3
I need thee every hour, in joy or pain;
come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

4
I need thee every hour; teach me thy will;
and thy rich promises in me fulfill.
