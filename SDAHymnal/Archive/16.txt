16  All People That on Earth Do Well


1

All people that on earth do dwell, sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.

Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell; come ye before him and rejoice.


2

Know that the Lord is God indeed; without our aid he did us make; we are his folk, he doth us feed, and for his sheep he doth us take.


3

O enter then his gates with praise; approach with joy his courts unto; praise, laud, and bless his name always, for it is seemly so to do.


4

For why! the Lord our God is good; his mercy is forever sure;

his truth at all times firmly stood, and shall from age to age endure.
