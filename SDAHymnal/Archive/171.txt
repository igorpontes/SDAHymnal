171  Thine Is the Glory


1

Thine is the glory, Risen, conquering Son; Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won. Angels in bright raiment Rolled the stone away,

Kept the folded grave-clothes Where Thy body lay.


Refrain

Thine is the glory, Risen, conquering Son; Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won.


2

Lo! Jesus meets us. Risen from the tomb, Lovingly He greets us, Scatters fear and gloom;

Let His Church with gladness Hymns of triumph sing,

For her Lord now liveth; Death has lost its sting.


3
No more we doubt Thee, Glorious Prince of life! Life is nought without Thee; Aid us in our strife;

Make us more than conquerors, Through Thy deathless love; Bring us safe through Jordan To Thy home above.
