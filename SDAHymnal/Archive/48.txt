48  Softly Now the Light of Day


1

Softly now the light of day Fades upon out sight away: Free from care, from labor free,

Lord, we would commune with Thee.


2

Thou, whose allpervading eye Nought escapes, without, within, Pardon each infirmity,

Open fault, and secret sin.


3

Soon from us the light of day Shall forever pass away; Then, from sin and sorrow free,

Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.
