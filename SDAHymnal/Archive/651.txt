Happy the Home That Welcomes You

1
Happy the home that welcomes You, Lord Jesus,
Truest of friends, most honored guest of all,
Where hearts and eyes are bright with joy to greet You,
Your lightest wishes eager to fulfill.

2
Happy the home where men and wife together
Are of one mind believing in Your love:
Through love and pain, prosperity and hardship,
Through good and evil days Your care they prove.

3
Happy the home, O loving Friend of children,
Where they are giv’n to You with hands of prayer,
Where at Your feet they early learn to listen
To Your own words, and thank You for Your care.
