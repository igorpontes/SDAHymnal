Like Jesus

1
Teach, me, Father, what to say;
Teach me, Father, how to pray;
Teach me all along the way
How to be like Jesus.

Refrain:
I would be like Jesus,
I would be like Jesus!
Help me, Lord, to daily grow
More and more like Jesus!

2
Teach me as the days go by,
Teach me not to reason why,
Teach me that to do and die,
Is to be like Jesus.

3
Teach me that the time is short,
Teach me how to live and work,
Teach me that to never shirk
Is to be like Jesus.
4
Teach me how we may be one,
Like the Father and the Son;
And when all is overcome,
I will be like Jesus.
