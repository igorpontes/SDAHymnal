119  Angels From the Realms of Glory


1

Angels from the realms of glory, Wing your flight o`er all the earth; Ye, who sang creation`s story, Now proclaim Messiah`s birth;

Come and worship, Come and worship, Worship Christ, the newborn King.


2

Shepherds, in the field abiding, Watching o`er your flocks by night, God with man is now residing; Yonder shines the Infant Light;

Come and worship, Come and worship, Worship Christ, the newborn King.


3

Sages, leave your contemplations, Brighter visions beam afar;

Seek the great Desire of nations; Ye have seen His natal star;

Come and worship, Come and worship, Worship Christ, the newborn King.


4

Saints, before the altar bending, Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, descending, In His temple shall appear;

Come and worship, Come and worship, Worship Christ, the newborn King.
