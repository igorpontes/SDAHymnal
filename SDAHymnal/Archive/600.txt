Hold Fast Till I Come

1
Sweet promise is given to all who believe–
“Behold I come quickly, Mine own to receive;
Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;
Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait.”

Refrain:
“Hold fast till I come,” sweet promise of heaven–
“The kingdom restored, to you shall be given.”
“Come, enter My joy, sit down on the throne;
Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come.”

2
We’ll “watch unto prayer” with lamps burning bright;
He comes to all others a “thief in the night.”
We know He is near, but know not the day–
As spring shows that summer is not far away.

3
Yes! this is our hope, ’tis built on His word–
The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;
Of promises all, it stands as the sum:
“Behold I come quickly; hold fast till I come.”
