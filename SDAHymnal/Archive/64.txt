64  Lord, Dismiss Us With Thy Blessing


1

Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing; fill our hearts with joy and peace; let us each, thy love possessing, triumph in redeeming grace.

O refresh us, O refresh us, traveling through this wilderness.


2

Thanks we give and adoration for thy gospel's joyful sound. May the fruits of thy salvation in our hearts and lives abound; ever faithful, ever faithful
to the truth may we be found.
