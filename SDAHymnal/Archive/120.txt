120  There's a Song in the Air


1

There's a song in the air! There's a star in the sky! There's a mother's deep prayer And a baby's low cry!

And the star rains its fire while the beautiful sing, For the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King!


2

There's a tumult of joy O'er the wonderful birth, For the virgin's sweet boy Is the Lord of the earth. Aye! the star rains its fire while the beautiful sing,

For the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King!


3

In the light of that star Lie the ages impearled; And that song from afar Has swept over the world. Every hearth is aflame and the beautiful sing
In the homes of the nations that Jesus is King!


4

We rejoice in the light, And we echo the song

That comes down through the night From the heavenly throng.

Aye! we shout to the lovely evangel they bring, And we greet in His cradle
our Savior and King!
