We Praise Thee With Our Minds

1
We praise Thee with our minds,
O Lord
Kept sharp think Thy thought;
Come,
Holy Ghost with grace outpoured,
To teach what Christ hath taught.

In all our learning may we seek
That wisdom from above
Which comes to all: the brave,
the meek
Who ask in faith and love.

2
We praise Thee thro’ our bodies,
Lord,
Kept strong to do Thy will;

Thy Spirit’s temples, which afford
A means to praise Thee still.
We give ourselves, a sacrifice,
To live as unto Thee;
For Thou alone hast paid the price
To bring salvation free.


3
We praise Thee in our hearts,
O king,
Kept pure to know Thy ways;
And raise to Thee a hymn to sing

Eternally Thy praise.
Altho adoring hearts will bow

As age on ages roll;
We praise Thee in our beings now,
Mind, body, heart, and soul.
