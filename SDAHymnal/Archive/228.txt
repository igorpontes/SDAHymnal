A Hymn of Glory Let Us Sing

1
A hymn of glory let us sing;
New hymns thro’-out the world shall ring
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Christ, by a road before untrod,
Ascends unto the throne of God.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

2
O Lord, our homeward pathway bend,
That our unwearied hearts ascend.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Where, seated on Your Father’s throne,
You reign as King of kings alone.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

3
Give us Your joy on earth, O Lord,
In heav’n to be our great reward.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
When throned with You forever, we
Shall praise Your name eternally.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

4
O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
All praise to you let earth accord:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
You are, while endless ages run,
With Father and with Spirit one.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
