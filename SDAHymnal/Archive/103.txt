103  O God, Our Help in Ages Past


1

O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come,

our shelter from the stormy blast, and our eternal home!


2

Under the shadow of thy throne, still may we dwell secure; sufficient is thine arm alone, and our defense is sure.


3

Before the hills in order stood, or earth received her frame, from everlasting, thou art God, to endless years the same.


4

A thousand ages, in thy sight, are like an evening gone;

short as the watch that ends the night, before the rising sun.


5

O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come;
be thou our guide while life shall last, and our eternal home!
