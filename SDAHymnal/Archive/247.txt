Come, My Way

1
There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

Refrain:
O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus-
Because He first loved me!

2
It tells me of a Savior’s love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner’s perfect plea.

3
It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.
