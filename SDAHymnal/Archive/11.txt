11  The God of Abraham Praise


1

The God of Abraham praise, Who reigns enthroned above; Ancient of everlasting days, And God of love;

Jehovah! Great I AM!

By earth and heaven confessed; I bow and bless the sacred name, Forever blest.


2

The God of Abraham praise, At whose supreme command

From earth I rise, and seek the joys At His right hand;

I all on earth forsake,

Its wisdom, fame and power; And Him my only portion make, My shield and tower.


3

The whole triumphant host Give thanks to God on high;

"Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!" They ever cry;

Hail, Abraham's God and mine! I join the heavenly lays;
All might and majesty are Thine, And endless praise.
