43  When Morning Gilds the Skies


1

When morning gilds the skies my heart awaking cries, May Jesus Christ be praised!

Alike at work and prayer, to Jesus I repair: May Jesus Christ be praised!


2

Whene'er the sweet church bell peals over hill and dell, May Jesus Christ praised!

O hark to what it sings, as joyously it rings, May Jesus Christ be praised!


3

The night becomes as day when from the heart we say: May Jesus Christ be praised!

The powers of darkness fear when this sweet chant they hear: May Jesus Christ be praised!


4

Ye nations of mankind, in this your concord find, May Jesus Christ praised!

Let all the earth around ring joyous with the sound, May Jesus Christ praised!


5

In heaven's eternal bliss the loveliest strain is this, May Jesus Christ praised!
Let earth, and sea and sky from depth to height reply, May Jesus Christ praised!


6

Be this, while life is mine, my canticle divine: May Jesus Christ be praised!

Be this th'eternal song through all the ages long, May Jesus Christ be praised!
