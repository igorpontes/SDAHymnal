70  Praise Ye the Father


1

Praise ye the Father for His loving kindness, Tenderly cares He for His erring children; Praise Him, ye angels, praise Him in the heavens; Praise ye Jehovah!


2

Praise ye the Savior, great is the compassion, Graciously cares He for His chosen people; Young men and maidens, ye old men and children, Praise ye the Savior!


3

Praise ye the Spirit, comforter of Israel, Sent of the Father and the Son to bless us; Praise ye the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Praise the Eternal Three!
