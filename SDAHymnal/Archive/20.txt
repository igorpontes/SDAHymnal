20  O Praise Ye the Lord


1

O praise ye the Lord! Praise Him in the height; Rejoice in His word, Ye angels of light;

Ye heavens, adore Him By whom ye were made, And worship before Him, In brightness arrayed.


2

O praise ye the Lord! Praise Him upon earth, In tuneful accord:

Ye sons of new birth; Praise Him who hath brought you His grace from above, Praise Him who hath taught you To sing of His love.


3
O praise ye the Lord,

All things that give sound; Each jubilant chord, Re-echo around;

Loud organs His glory Forth tell in deep tone,
And sweet harp, the story Of what He hath done.


4

O praise ye the Lord! Thanksgiving and song To Him be outpoured All ages along:

For love in creation, For heaven restored. For grace of salvation, O praise ye the Lord!
