163  At the Cross


1

Alas! and did my Savior bleed, and did my Sovereign die? Would he devote that sacred head for sinners such as I?


Refrain

At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light,

and the burden of my heart rolled away; it was there by faith I received my sight, and now I am happy all the day!


2

Was it for crimes that I have done, he groaned upon the tree? Amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree!


3

But drops of grief can ne'er repay the debt of love I owe:

Here, Lord, I give myself away; 'tis all that I can do!
