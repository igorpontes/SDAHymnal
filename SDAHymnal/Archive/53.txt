53  All Praise to Thee


1

All praise to thee, my God, this night, for all the blessings of the light! Keep me, O keep me, King of kings, beneath thine own almighty wings.


2

Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son, the ill that I this day have done,

that with the world, myself, and thee, I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.


3

O may my soul on thee repose,

and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close, sleep that may me more vigorous make to serve my God when I awake.


4

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; praise him, all creatures here below; praise him above, ye heavenly host; praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
