135  O Little Town of Bethlehem


1

O little town of Bethlehem How still we see thee lie! Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent stars go by; Yet in thy dark streets shineth The everlasting light;

The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee tonight.


2

For Christ is born of Mary; And gathered all above, While mortals sleep,

the angels keep Their watch of wondering love.

O morning stars, together Proclaim the holy birth!

And praises sing to God the King, And peace to men on earth.


3

How silently, how silently The wondrous gift is given!

So God imparts to human hearts The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming; But in this world of sin, Where meek souls will recieve Him still,

The dear Christ enters in.


4

O holy Child of Bethlehem, Descend to us, we pray; Cast out our sin and enter in-- Be born in us today.

We hear the Christmas angels The great glad tidings tell-- Oh, come to us, abide with us, Our Lord Immanuel!
