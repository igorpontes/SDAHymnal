All creatures of our God and King 


1

All creatures of our God and King, Lift up your voice with us and sing: Alleluia! Alleluia!

O burning sun with golden beam And silver moon with softer gleam:


Refrain

Oh, praise Him! Oh, praise Him! Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!


2

O rushing wind and breezes soft, O clouds that ride the winds aloft: Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!

O rising morn, in praise rejoice, O lights of evening, find a voice.


3

0 flowing waters, pure and clear, Make music for your Lord to hear. Oh praise Him! Alleluia!

O fire so masterful and bright, Providing us with warmth and light.


4

Let all things their Creator bless,
And worship him in humbleness, O praise him Alleluia!

Oh, praise the Father, praise the Son, And praise the Spirit, three in One!
