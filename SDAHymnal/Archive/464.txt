When I Can Read My Title Clear

1
When I can read my title clear
To mansions in the skies
I’ll bid farewell to every fear,
And wipe my weeping eyes;
And wipe my weeping eyes,
And wipe my weeping eyes,
I’ll bid farewell to every fear,
And wipe my weeping eyes.

2
Should earth against my soul engage,
And fiery darts be hurled,
Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,
And face a frowning world;
And face a frowning world,
And face a frowning world,
Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,
And face a frowning world.
