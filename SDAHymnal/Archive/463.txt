Peace, Perfect Peace

1
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

2
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
To do the will of Jesus: this is rest.

3
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
In Jesus’ keeping we are safe, and they.

4
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
