Hail Him the King of Glory

1
Tell it to every kindred and nation,
Tell it far and near;
Earth’s darkest night will fade with the dawning,
Jesus will soon appear.

Refrain:
Hail Him the King of glory,
Once the Lamb for sinners slain;
Tell, tell the wondrous story,
“Jesus comes to reign.”

2
Nations again in strife and commotion,
Warnings by the way;
Signs in the heavens, unerring omens,
Herald the glorious day.

3
Children of God look up with rejoicing;
Shout and sing His praise;
Blessèd are they who, waiting and watching,
Look for the dawning rays.
