Give Me Jesus

1
In the morning, when I rise
In the morning, when I rise
In the morning, when I rise

Refrain:
Give me Jesus.
Give me Jesus,
Give me Jesus.
You can have all this world,
Just give me Jesus.

2
Dark mid-night was my cry,
Dark mid-night was my cry,
Dark midnight was my cry,
Give me Jesus.

3
Just about the break of day,
Just about the break of day,
Just about the break of day,
Give me Jesus.

4
Oh, when I come to die,
Oh, when I come to die,
Oh, when I come to die,
Give me Jesus.
