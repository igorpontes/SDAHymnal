51  Day Is Dying in the West


1
Day is dying in the west;

Heaven is touching earth with rest; Wait and worship while the night Sets the evening lamps alight Through all the sky.


Refrain

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts! Heaven and earth are full of Thee! Heaven and earth are praising Thee, O Lord most high!


2

Lord of life, beneath the dome Of the universe, Thy home, Gather us who seek Thy face To the fold of Thy embrace, For Thou art nigh.


3

While the deepening shadows fall, Heart of love enfolding all, Through the glory and the grace Of the stars that veil Thy face, Our hearts ascend.
4

When forever from our sight Pass the stars, the day, the night, Lord of angels, on our eyes

Let eternal morning rise And shadows end.
