15  My Maker and My King


1

My Maker and my King, To Thee my all I owe;

Thy sovereign bounty is the spring Whence all my blessings flow; Thy sovereign bounty is the spring Whence all my blessings flow.


2

The creature of Thy hand, On Thee alone I live;

My God, Thy benefits demand More praise than I can give. My God, Thy benefits demand More praise than I can give.


3

Lord, what can I impart When all is Thine before?

Thy love demands a thankful heart; The gift, alas! how poor.

Thy love demands a thankful heart; The gift, alas! how poor.


4

O! let Thy grace inspire

My soul with strength divine;
Let every word each desire And all my days be Thine. Let every word each desire And all my days be Thine.
