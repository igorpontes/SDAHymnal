We Give This Child to You

1
We give this child to You,
Our precious gift of love.
Help us to lead each step aright
With guidance from above.

2
O bless each child of Yours,
And grant when they are grown,
They will have learned to love Your way,
And choose it for their own.

3
We give ourselves to You,
And may Your Spirit fill
Our hearts and home, that all we do
Be subject to Your will.
