Go Forth, Go Forth With Christ

1
Go forth, go forth with Christ,
Who called you to this day,
He who has led, will lead
And keep you in His way:
His word is fast, His promise sure
To all who serve Him and endure.

2
Go forth, go forth with Christ,
With purpose not your own,
Each vict’ry you shall gain
Through Him your Lord alone:
To guard you in fidelity
His Spirit shall your strength’ner be.

3
Go forth, go forth with Christ,
His Priesthood you shall share,
Who bought us by His blood
To be His servants here:
Walk in the way your Savior trod,
Go forth with Him, go forth with God.
