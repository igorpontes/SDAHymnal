Hark! 'Tis the Shepherd's Voice I Hear

1
Hark! ’tis the Shepherd’s voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who’ve gone astray,
Far from the Shepherd’s fold away.

Refrain:
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring the wanderers to Jesus.

2
Who’ll go and help the Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wandering ones to find?
Who’ll bring them back into the fold,
Where they’ll be sheltered from the cold?

3
Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountain wild and high,
Hark! ’tis the Master speaks to thee,
“Go, find My sheep where ‘er they be.”
