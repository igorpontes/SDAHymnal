This Is the Threefold Truth

1
This is the threefold truth
On which our faith depends;
And with this joyful cry
Worship begins and ends;
Refrain:
Christ has died!
Christ is risen!
Christ will come again!

2
By this we are upheld
When doubt and grief assails
Our Christian fortitude,
And only grace avails.
Refrain:
Christ has died!
Christ is risen!
Christ will come again!

3
This is the threefold truth
Which, if we hold it fast,
Changes the world and us
And brings us home at last.
Refrain:
Christ has died!
Christ is risen!
Christ will come again!
