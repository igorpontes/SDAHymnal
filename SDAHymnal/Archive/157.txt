157  Go to Dark Gethsemane


1
Go to dark Gethsemane,

ye that feel the tempter's power; your Redeemer's conflict see, watch with him one bitter hour. Turn not from his griefs away; learn of Jesus Christ to pray.


2

See him at the judgment hall, beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned; O the wormwood and the gall! O the pangs his soul sustained!

Shun not suffering, shame, or loss; learn of Christ to bear the cross.


3

Calvary's mournful mountain climb; there, adoring at his feet,

mark that miracle of time, God's own sacrifice complete. "It is finished!" hear him cry; learn of Jesus Christ to die.
