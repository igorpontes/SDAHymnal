82  Before Jehova's Awful Throne


1

Before Jehovah's awful throne, Ye nations, bow with sacred joy; Know that the Lord is God alone; He can create, and He destroy.


2

His sovereign power, without our aid, Made us of clay, and formed us men;

and when like wandering sheep we strayed, He brought us to His fold again.


3

We'll crowd His gates with thankful songs, High as the heavens our voices raise; And earth, with her ten thousand tongues, Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.


4

Wide as the world is His command, Vast as Eternity His love;

Firm as a rock His truth shall stand, When rolling years shall cease to move.
