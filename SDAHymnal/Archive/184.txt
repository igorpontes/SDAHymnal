184  Jesus Paid It All


1
I hear the Savior say,

"Thy strength indeed is small; Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all."


Refrain

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;

Sin had left a crimson stain; He washed it white as snow.


2

Lord, now indeed I find Thy power, and Thine alone, Can change the leper's spots, And melt the heart of stone.


3

Since nothing good have I Whereby Thy grace to claim, I'll wash my garment white

In the blood of Calvary's Lamb.


4

And when before the throne I stand in Him complete,
I'll lay my trophies down, All down at Jesus' feet.
