76  O Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go


1

O Love that wilt not let me go, I rest my weary soul in thee; I give thee back the life I owe, that in thine ocean depths

its flow may richer, fuller be.


2

O Light that followest all my way, I yield my flickering torch to thee; my heart restores its borrowed ray, that in they sunshine's blaze

its day may brighter, fairer be.


3

O Joy that seekest me through pain, I cannot close my heart to thee;

I trace the rainbow thru the rain, and feel the promise is not vain, that morn shall tearless be.


4

O Cross that liftest up my head, I dare not ask to fly from thee; I lay in dust life's glory dead,

and from the ground there blossoms red life that shall endless be.
