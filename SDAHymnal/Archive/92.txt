92  This Is My Father's World


1

This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears

all nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres.

This is my Father's world: I rest me in the thought

of rocks and trees, of skies and seas; his hand the wonders wrought.


2

This is my Father's world, the birds their carols raise,

the morning light, the lily white, declare their maker's praise. This is my Father's world:
he shines in all that's fair;

in the rustling grass I hear him pass; he speaks to me everywhere.


3

This is my Father's world. O let me ne'er forget

that though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet.

This is my Father's world: why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is King; let the heavens ring! God reigns; let the earth be glad!
