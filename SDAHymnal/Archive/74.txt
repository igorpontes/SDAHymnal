74  Like a River Glorious


1

Like a river glorious, is God's perfect peace, Over all victorious, in its bright increase; Perfect, yet it floweth, fuller every day, Perfect, yet it groweth, deeper all the way.


Refrain

Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blessed Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.


2

Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand, Never foe can follow, never traitor stand; Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care, Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.


3

Every joy or trial falleth from above, Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love; We may trust Him fully all for us to do.

They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.
