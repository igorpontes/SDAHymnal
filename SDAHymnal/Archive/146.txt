146  I Think When I Read That Sweet Story


1

I think when I read that sweet story of old, When Jesus was here among men,

How He called little children as lambs to His fold,

I should like to have been with Him then.


2

I wish that His hands had been placed on my head, That His arm had been thrown around me,

And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,

"Let the little ones come unto Me."


3

I long for the joy of that glorious time, The sweetest and brightest and best, When the dear little children of every clime Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.
