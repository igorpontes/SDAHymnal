73  Holy, Holy, Holy


1
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!

Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee; Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!

God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!


2

Holy, holy, holy! Angels adore Thee,

Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea; Thousands and ten thousands worship low before Thee, Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.


3

Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee, Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see; Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee, Perfect in power, in love, and purity.


4

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!

All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth, and sky, and sea; Holy, holy, holy; merciful and mighty!

God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
