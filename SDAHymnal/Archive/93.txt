93  All Things Bright and Beautiful


1*

All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful, The Lord made them all.


2

Each little flower that opens, Each little bird that sings; He made their glowing colors, He made their tiny wings.


3

The purpleheaded mountain, The river running by

The sunset, and the morning That brightens up the sky,


4

The cold wind in the winter, The pleasant summer sun, The ripe fruits in the garden, He made them every one.


5

He gave us eyes to see them, And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.
