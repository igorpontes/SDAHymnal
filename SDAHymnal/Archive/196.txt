196  Tell Me the Old, Old Story


1

Tell me the old, old story, Of unseen things above, Of Jesus and His glory, Of Jesus and His love; Tell me the story simply, As to a little child,

For I am weak and weary, And helpless and defiled.


2

Tell me the story softly, With earnest tones and grave; Remember I'm the sinner Whom Jesus came to save; Tell me the story always, If you would really be,

In any time of trouble, A comforter to me.


3

Tell me the same old story, When you have cause to fear That this world's empty glory Is costing me too dear; Yes, and when that world's glory Is dawning on my soul,

Tell me the old, old story: "Christ Jesus makes thee whole."
