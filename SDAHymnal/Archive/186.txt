186  I've Found a Friend


1

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! He loved me ere I knew Him;

He drew me with the cords of love, And thus He bound me to Him.

And 'round my heart still closely twine Those ties which nought can sever, For I am His, and He is mine, Forever and forever.


2

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! He bled, He died to save me;

And not alone the gift of life, But His own self He gave me. Nought that I have my own I call, I hold it for the Giver;

My heart, my strength, my life my all, Are His, and His forever.


3

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! All power to Him is given;

To guard me on my upward course, And bring me safe to heaven.

The eternal glories gleam afar, To nerve my faint endeavor;
So now to watch, to work, to war, And then to rest forever.


4

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend! So kind, and true, and tender,

So wise a counselor and guide, So mighty a defender.

From Him, who loveth me so well, What power my soul can sever? Shall life or death, or earth, or hell? No; I am His forever.
