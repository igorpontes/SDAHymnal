We Know Not the Hour

1
We know not the hour of the Master’s appearing;
Yet signs all foretell that the moment is nearing
When He shall return ’tis the promise most cheering
But we know not the hour.

Refrain:
He will come, let us watch and be ready;
He will come, hallelujah! hallelujah!
He will come in the clouds of His Father’s
bright glory but we know not the hour.

2
There’s light for the wise who are seeking salvation;
There’s truth in the book of the Lord’s revelation;
Each prophecy points to the great comsummation
But we know not the hour.

3
We’ll watch and we’ll pray, with our lamps trimmed and burning;
We’ll work and we’ll wait till the Master’s returning;
We’ll sing and rejoice, every omen discerning
But we know not the hour.
