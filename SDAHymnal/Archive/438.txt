You Will See Your Lord A-Coming

1
You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming
In a few more days.

Refrain:
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music
which is sounding thro’ the air.

2
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet
In a few more days.

3
You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising
In a few more days.
4
Angels bear them to the Savior,
Angels bear them to the Savior,
Angels bear them to the Savior
In a few more days.

5
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over
In a few more days.
