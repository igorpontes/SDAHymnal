There's No Other Name Like Jesus

1
There’s no other name like Jesus,
‘Tis the dearest name we know,
‘Tis the angel’s joy in heaven,
‘Tis the Christian’s joy below.

Refrain:
Sweet name, (sweet name) dear name, (dear name)
There’s no other name like Jesus;
Sweet name, (sweet name) dear name, (dear name)
There’s no other name like Jesus.
2
There’s no other name like Jesus
When the heart with grief is sad,
There’s no other name like Jesus
When the heart is free and glad.

3
‘Tis the hope that I shall see Him
When in glory He appears,
‘Tis the hope to hear His welcome
That my fainting spirit cheers.

4
If He wills that I should labor
In His vineyard day by day,
Then ’tis well if only Jesus
Blesses all I do or say.

5
If He wills that death’s cold finger
Touch my feeble, mortal clay,
Then ’tis well if only Jesus
Is my dying trust and stay.
