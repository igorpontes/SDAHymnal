21  Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise


1

Immortal, invisible, God only wise, In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,

Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.


2

Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,

Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might; Thy justice, like mountains, high soaring above

Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.


3

To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small; In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;

We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree, And wither and perish - but naught changeth Thee.


4

Great Father of glory, pure Father of light, Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight; All praise we would render; O help us to see 'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee!
