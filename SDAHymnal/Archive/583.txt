You That Know the Lord

1
You that know the Lord is gracious,
You for whom a cornerstone
Stands, of God elect and precious,
Laid that you may build there-on,
See that on that sure foundation
You a living temple raise.
Towers that may tell forth salvation,
Walls that may reech-o praise.

2
Living stones by God appointed
Each to his allotted place,
Kings and priests, by God anointed,
Shall you not declare His grace?
You, a royal generation,
Tell the tidings of your birth,
Tidings of a new creation
To an old and weary earth.

3
Tell the praise of Him who called you
Out of darkness into light,
Broke the fetters that enthralled you,
Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:
Tell the tale of sins forgiven,
Strength renewed and hope restored,
Till the earth, in tune with heaven,
Praise and magnify the Lord.
