101  Children of the Heavenly Father


1

Children of the heavenly Father Safely in His bossom gather; Nestling bird nor star in heaven Such a refuge e'er was given.


2

God His own doth tend and nourish, In His holy love they flourish; From all evil things He spares them, In His mighty arms He bears them.


3

Neither life nor death shall ever From the Lord His children sever; Unto them His grace He showeth, And their sorrows all He knoweth.


4

Praise the Lord in joyful numbers, Your Protector never slumbers; At the will of your Defender Every foe-man must surrender.


5

Though He giveth or He taketh, God His children ne'er forsaketh;
His the loving purpose solely To preserve them pure and holy.
