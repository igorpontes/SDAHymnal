99  God Will Take Care of You


1

Be not dismayed whate'er betide, God will take care of you; beneath his wings of love abide, God will take care of you.


Refrain

God will take care of you, through every day, o'er all the way; he will take care of you,

God will take care of you.


2

Through days of toil when heart doth fail, God will take care of you;

when dangers fierce your path assail, God will take care of you.


3

All you may need he will provide, God will take care of you; nothing you ask will be denied, God will take care of you.


4

No matter what may be the test, God will take care of you;
lean, weary one, upon his breast, God will take care of you.
