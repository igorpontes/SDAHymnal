Good Christians, Now Rejoice

1
Good Christians, now rejoice,
With heart, and soul, and voice;
Give ye heed to what we say:
Jesus Christ is born today;
Ox and ass before Him bow,
And He is in the manger now.
Crist is born today!
Crist is born today!

2
Good Christians, now rejoice,
With heart, and soul, and voice;
Now ye hear of endless bliss:
Jesus Christ was born for this!
He hath ope’d the heav’nly door,
And we are blessed evermore.
Christ was born for this!
Christ was born for this!

3
Good Christians, now rejoice,
With heart, and soul, and voice;
Now ye need not fear the grave:
Jesus Christ was born to save!
Calls you one and calls you all
To gain His everlasting hall.
Christ was born to save!
Christ was born to save!
