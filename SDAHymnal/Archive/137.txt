137  We Three Kings


1

We three kings of Orient are; Bearing gifts we traverse afar

Field and fountain, moor and mountain, Following yonder star.


Refrain

O star of wonder, star of night, Star with royal beauty bright, Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to Thy perfect light.


2

Born a King on Bethlehem's plain, Gold I bring to crown Him again, King forever, ceasing never

Over us all to reign.


3

Frankincense to offer have I; Incense owns a Deity nigh; Prayer and praising all men raising, Worship Him, God on high.


4

Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume Breathes a life of gathering gloom:
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, Sealed in the stonecold tomb.


5

Glorious now behold Him arise, King and God and sacrifice; Alleluia, Alleluia!

Sounds through the earth and skies.
