159  The Old Rugged Cross


1

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, the emblem of suffering and shame;

and I love that old cross where the dearest and best for a world of lost sinners was slain.


Refrain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross,

and exchange it some day for a crown.


2

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, has a wondrous attraction for me;

for the dear Lamb of God left his glory above to bear it to dark Calvary.


3

To that old rugged cross I will ever be true, its shame and reproach gladly bear;

then he'll call me some day to my home far away, where his glory forever I'll share.
