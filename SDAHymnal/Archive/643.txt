Father, Who on Us Do Shower

1
Father, who on us do shower
Gifts of plenty form Your dower,
To Your people give the power
All Your gifts to use aright.

2
Give pure happiness in leisure
Temperance in every pleasure,
Wholesome use of earthly treasure
Bodies clean and spirits bright.

3
Lift from this and every nation
All that brings us degradation;
Quell the forces of temptation;
Put Your enemies to flight.

4
Father, You who sought and found us,
Son of God, whose love has bound us,
Holy Spirit, in us, round us,
Hear us, Godhead infinite.
