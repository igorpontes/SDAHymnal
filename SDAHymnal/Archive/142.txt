142  Angels We Have Heard on High


1

Angels we have heard on high, Singing sweetly through the night, And the mountains, in reply, Echoing their brave delight.


Refrain

Gloria, in excelsis Deo,
Gloria in excelsis Deo.


2

Shepherds, why this jubilee? Why this songs of happy cheer? What great brightness did you see? What glad tidings did you hear?


3

Come to Bethlehem and see Him whose birth the angels sing; Come adore, on bended knee,

Christ the Lord, the newborn King.


4

See Him in a manger laid, Whom the angels praise above; Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, While we raise our hearts in love.
