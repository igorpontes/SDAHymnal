56  The Day Thou Gavest


1

The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended; the darkness falls at Thy behest;

to Thee our morning hymns ascended; Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.


2

We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping while earth rolls onward into light, through all the world her watch is keeping, and rests not now by day or night.


3

As o'er each continent and island the dawn leads on another day, the voice of prayer is never silent, nor die the strains of praise away.


4

So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never, like earth's proud empires, pass away. Thy kingdom stands, and grows forever, till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.
