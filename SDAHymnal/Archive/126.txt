In the Bleak Midwinter

1
In the bleak midwinter
Frosty wind made moan;
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter,
Long ago.

2
Angels and archangels
May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air:
But His mother only
In her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved
With a kiss.

3
What can I give Him,
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb;
If I were a wise man
I would do my part;
Yet what can I give Him?
Give my heart.
