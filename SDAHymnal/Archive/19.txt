19  O Sing a New Song to the Lord


1

O sing a new song to the Lord For marvels He has done;

His right hand and His holy arm The victory have won.


2

With harp, and voice of psalms Unto Jehovah sing;

Let trumpets and the echoing horn Acclaim the Lord our King!


3

Let seas with all their creatures roar, The world and dwellers there,

And let the rivers clap their hands, The hills their joy declare.


4

Before the Lord: because He comes, To judge the earth come He;

He'll judge the world with righteousness, His folk with equity.
