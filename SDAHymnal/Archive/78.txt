For God So Loved Us

1
For God so loved us,
He sent the Savior:
For God so loved us,
and loves me too.

Refrain:
Love so unending!
I’ll sing His praises,
God loves His children,
loves even me.

2
He sent the Savior,
the blest Redeemer;
He sent the Savior
to set me free.

3
He bade me welcome,
O word of mercy;
He bade me welcome,
O voice divine.

4
Glory and honor,
O Love eternal,
To Him be given
while life shall last.
