'Tis Love That Makes Us Happy

1
‘Tis love that makes us happy,
‘Tis love that smooths the way;
It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.

Refrain:
God is love; we’re his little children.
God is love; we would be like Him.
‘Tis love that makes us happy,
‘Tis love that smooths the way;
It helps us “mind,” it makes us kind
To others every day.

2
This world is full of sorrow,
Of sickness, death, and sin;
With loving heart we’ll do our part,
And try some soul to win.

3
And when this life is over,
And we are called above
Our song shall be, eternally,
Of Jesus and His love.
