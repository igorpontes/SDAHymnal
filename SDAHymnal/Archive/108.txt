108  Amazing Grace


1

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found; was blind, but now I see.


2

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved;

how precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed.


3

The Lord has promised good to me, his word my hope secures;

he will my shield and portion be, as long as life endures.


4

Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come;

'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home.


5

When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun,
we've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun.
